For \\nclose to 4 years, the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) has critically reviewed the \\ngrowing body of research data on COVID-19 and used that information to develop and revise their \\nrecommendations for treating patients with this disease. The Panel has released a total of 72 versions of \\nthe Guidelines.\\nThe federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency ended in May 2023, and several professional societies \\ncurrently provide COVID-19 treatment guidelines for their medical specialties or subspecialties. \\nAccordingly, this will be the final update of the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines. \\nThe Panel members hope these Guidelines have been of value to health care providers, and they \\nappreciate the support and input they have received over the past 4 years. \\nThe COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines website will remain available until August 16, 2024, and will \\nprovide a downloadable PDF of the final version of the Guidelines.\\nFebruary 29, 2024\\nIn preparation for this final version of the Guidelines, the Panel reviewed all the sections that were not \\nupdated on December 20, 2023. The information in these sections is current as of February 2024. \\nThe Viral Rebound and Symptom Recurrence subsections in Therapeutic Management of \\nNonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 and Ritonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) have been \\nupdated with new references. The Panel noted that concerns about the recurrence of symptoms or viral \\nrebound should not be a reason to avoid using antiviral therapy when indicated.\\nThe Panel updated the discussion on the role of remdesivir in adults with COVID-19 who require \\nmechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in Therapeutic Management of \\nHospitalized Adults With COVID-19.\\nIn Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Children With COVID-19, the vaccination status \\ncategories that determine a child’s risk level for progression to severe disease have been changed from \\n“Unvaccinated,” “Primary Series,” and “Up to Date” to “Not Up to Date” and “Up to Date.” Chronic \\nkidney disease and pregnancy were added to the list of risk factors that are associated with progression \\nto severe COVID-19.\\nOther sections that were reviewed for this final version of the Guidelines can be found in:\\n• Clinical Management of Adults\\n• Clinical Management of Children\\n• Critical Care for Adults\\n• Critical Care for Children\\n• Antivirals, Including Antibody Products\\n• Immunomodulators\\n• Special Populations\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The \\ngoal of the Guidelines was to provide clinicians with guidance on caring for patients with COVID-19. \\nBecause clinical information about the optimal management of COVID-19 evolved quickly, a \\nmultidisciplinary panel of experts frequently updated the Guidelines based on their assessments of the \\nemerging evidence on treatments for this disease.\\nPanel Composition\\nThe COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) co-chairs appointed Panel members with clinical \\nexperience and expertise in adult or pediatric patient management, translational and clinical science, or \\nthe development of treatment guidelines. Panel members included representatives from federal agencies, \\nhealth care organizations, academic institutions, professional societies, and the community. Federal \\nagencies and professional societies represented on the Panel include:\\n• American Association for Respiratory Care\\n• American Association of Critical-Care Nurses\\n• American College of Chest Physicians\\n• American College of Emergency Physicians\\n• American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\\n• American Society of Hematology\\n• American Thoracic Society\\n• Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority\\n• Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n• Department of Defense\\n• Department of Veterans Affairs\\n• Food and Drug Administration\\n• Infectious Diseases Society of America\\n• National Institutes of Health\\n• Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society\\n• Society of Critical Care Medicine\\n• Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists\\nThe inclusion of representatives from professional societies does not imply that these societies endorsed \\nall elements of the Guidelines.\\nAppendix A, Table 1, provides the names and affiliations of the Panel members, ex officio members, \\nconsultants, and support team members on the Panel roster as of the final update of the Guidelines. \\nFinancial disclosures for the Panel members can be found in Appendix A, Table 2.\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Each working group was responsible for identifying relevant \\ninformation and published scientific literature and for conducting a systematic, comprehensive review \\nof that information and literature. The working groups proposed updates to the Guidelines based on the \\nlatest published research findings and clinical information. \\nV oting members of the Panel reviewed and voted on new Guidelines sections and recommendations. \\nA majority of voting members endorsed each recommendation statement before it was included in the \\nGuidelines. This requirement applied to recommendations for and against treatments and in cases when \\nthere was insufficient evidence to recommend either for or against treatments. Section updates that did \\nnot affect rated recommendations were approved by the Panel co-chairs without a Panel vote. During \\nthe development of the Guidelines, Panel members were required to keep all Panel deliberations and \\nevaluations of unpublished data confidential.\\nMethod of Synthesizing Data and Formulating Recommendations\\nThe working groups critically reviewed and synthesized the available data to develop recommendations. \\nDuring this process, the Panel evaluated the data, including the source of the data, the type of study \\n(e.g., randomized controlled trial, prospective or retrospective cohort study, case series, in vitro study), \\nthe quality and suitability of the methods, the number of participants, and the effect sizes observed. In \\naddition to evaluating data and reviewing clinical research on COVID-19, Panel members used clinical \\nexperiences with COVID-19 and other diseases to develop recommendations.\\nThe recommendations in these Guidelines are based on scientific evidence and expert opinion. Each \\nrecommendation includes 2 ratings: an uppercase letter (A, B, or C) that indicates the strength of the \\nrecommendation and a Roman numeral with or without a lowercase letter (I, IIa, IIb, or III) that \\nindicates the quality of the evidence that supports the recommendation (see Table 1). \\nThe ratings for the quality of the evidence reflect both the likelihood of bias in the treatment effect \\nestimate and the precision of the estimate.

However, the probability of severe \\nCOVID-19 is higher in people aged ≥65 years, those living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities, \\nthose who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 or who have poor responses to COVID-19 vaccines, \\nand those with certain chronic medical conditions. Data on comorbid health conditions among patients \\nwith COVID-19 indicate that patients with cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic \\nobstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes with complications, neurocognitive disorders, and obesity \\nare at increased risk of severe COVID-19. The risk appears to be higher in patients with multiple \\ncomorbid conditions. Other conditions that may lead to a high risk of severe COVID-19 include cancer, \\ncystic fibrosis, immunocompromising conditions, liver disease (especially in patients with cirrhosis), \\npregnancy, and sickle cell disease. Transplant recipients and people who are taking immunosuppressive \\nmedications are also at high risk of severe COVID-19.1 See Clinical Spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 Infection \\nfor a description of the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a discussion of the \\nspectrum of disease.\\nAlthough COVID-19 vaccination does not eliminate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination does \\nsignificantly reduce the risk of COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality, particularly in individuals \\nwho are at high risk of progressing to severe disease.2,3 \\nRacial and Ethnic Minorities and Other Marginalized Groups \\nCommunities that have been historically marginalized or made socially vulnerable due to a lack of \\naccess to health care or an inability to socially isolate are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, \\nCOVID-19–related hospitalization, and death. These communities include racial and ethnic minorities, \\nessential non-health care workers, and some people with disabilities.\\nKey Considerations\\n• The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommends that health care providers, health \\ncare systems, and payers ensure equitable access to high-quality care and treatment for all \\npatients, regardless of race, ethnic identity, or other minoritized identity or social status (AIII). \\n“Minoritized” refers to social groups that have been deprived of power and status by the dominant \\nculture in society and encompasses not just racial identities but other identities as well, including \\ngender identity and sexual orientation.4 \\n• Promoting equitable care for these groups must include considering the full range of medical, \\ndemographic, and social factors that may negatively impact health outcomes. \\n• Clinicians should be aware that pulse oximeters may not accurately detect hypoxemia in people \\nwith darker skin pigmentation.5,6 This may delay treatment and lead to worse clinical outcomes in \\npatients with COVID-19.7 See Clinical Spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 Infection for more information.\\n• Supporting equitable access to high-quality care and treatment for all patients is now an imperative \\nfor all health care organizations accredited by the Joint Commission, as well as a priority for the \\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health agencies.\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Black/African American people, Hispanic people, and American Indian/Alaska \\nNative people also experience rates of hospitalization that are more than 2 times higher and rates of \\nCOVID-19–related death that are approximately 2 times higher than those experienced by White people. \\nThe largest disparities were observed among American Indian/Alaska Native people, who experienced a \\nrate of hospitalization almost 3 times higher and a rate of death 2.1 times higher than White people.9\\nThe increased risk of severe COVID-19 among racial and ethnic minority groups may be partly \\nattributed to higher rates of comorbid conditions in these populations (e.g., cardiovascular disease, \\ndiabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, obesity, pulmonary disease).9\\nDisparities in Access to Care \\nMembers of racial and ethnic minority groups have an increased risk of exposure to COVID-19 \\nand decreased access to care. Large-scale mobility data reveals that people living in lower-income \\ncommunities were less able to physically isolate during COVID-19 emergency declarations,10 as \\nmembers of these communities were frequently unable to work from home.11 A 2020 study evaluating \\naccess to health care resources in New York City found that in areas of the city where the majority of \\nthe population was Black/African American and Hispanic, there were higher COVID-19 positivity rates \\nand fewer licensed hospital beds and intensive care unit beds than in areas where the majority of the \\npopulation was White.12 \\nDisparities in Access to COVID-19 Treatments\\nData from 41 U.S. health care systems reveal racial and ethnic disparities in the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 \\nmonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the treatment of COVID-19.13 Black/African American patients, \\nAsian patients, and patients of other races were, respectively, 22.4%, 48.3%, and 46.5% less likely to \\nreceive anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs for the treatment of COVID-19 than White patients.13,14 Disparities \\nhave also been observed in the dispensing rates for ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and \\nmolnupiravir. One study reported that between April and July 2022, Black/African American patients \\nwere prescribed ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir 35.8% less often than White patients, and Hispanic \\npatients were prescribed this drug 29.9% less often than White patients.15 Despite a greater number of \\ndispensing sites in neighborhoods with a higher social vulnerability, oral antivirals were prescribed at a \\nlower rate for patients with COVID-19 who were living in these areas than in those with a lesser degree \\nof social vulnerability.16 These disparities are not limited to outpatient settings. One retrospective cohort \\nstudy of veterans hospitalized with COVID-19 reported that Black veterans had lower odds of receiving \\nCOVID-19–specific treatments, including systemic steroids, remdesivir, and immunomodulators, than \\nWhite veterans.17  \\nOther Marginalized Groups\\nOther marginalized groups also experience worse outcomes for COVID-19. Hospitalization rates \\nfor COVID-19 among Medicare beneficiaries who were eligible for disability were approximately \\n50% higher than those among people who were eligible for Medicare based on age alone, and this \\ndiscrepancy disproportionately affected Black/African American people, Hispanic people, and American \\nIndian/Alaska Native people.18 \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

These high rates can be attributed to overcrowding, an inability to physically isolate, and \\ninadequate access to health care.19-21  \\nGiven the pervasiveness of disparities in access to care and provision of treatment, it is imperative for \\nclinicians, working with others on the patient care team, to assess the social factors that contribute to \\naccess and quality gaps and to strive to provide equitable treatment to all patients. These issues have \\nbeen identified as a strategic priority by the Joint Commission and the CDC.\\nSARS-CoV-2 Variants \\nLike other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving through random mutations. New mutations \\ncan potentially increase or decrease infectiousness and virulence. In addition, mutations can increase the \\nvirus’ ability to evade adaptive immune responses from previous SARS-CoV-2 infections or vaccination. \\nThis viral evolution may increase the risk of reinfection or decrease the efficacy of vaccines.22 There is \\nevidence that some SARS-CoV-2 variants have reduced susceptibility to plasma from people who were \\npreviously infected or immunized, as well as to anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs.23-25 \\nSince December 2020, the World Health Organization has assigned Greek letter designations to \\nseveral identified variants. A SARS-CoV-2 variant designated as a variant of concern displays certain \\ncharacteristics, such as increased transmissibility or virulence. In addition, vaccines and therapeutics \\nmay have decreased effectiveness against variants of concern, and the mutations found in these variants \\nmay interfere with the targets of diagnostic tests. The variant of interest designation has been used for \\nimportant variants that are not fully characterized; however, organizations do not use the same variant \\ndesignations, and they may define their variant designations differently.26,27 \\nIn September 2021, the CDC added a new designation for variants: variants being monitored. \\nThe data on these variants indicate a potential or clear impact on approved or authorized medical \\ncountermeasures, or these variants are associated with cases of more severe disease or increased \\ntransmission rates. However, these variants are either no longer detected or are circulating at very low \\nlevels in the United States; therefore, they do not pose a significant and imminent risk to public health in \\nthe United States.\\nThe Omicron variant was designated as a variant of concern in November 2021 and rapidly became the \\ndominant variant across the globe. The Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2 emerged in early \\nto mid-2022, followed by the subvariants BA.4, BA.5, BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB, EG.5, HV.1, and FL.1.5.1. \\nThe newer Omicron subvariants are generally more transmissible than previous variants and are not \\nsusceptible to any of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs that were previously authorized for the treatment and \\nprevention of COVID-19.24,25,28,29 \\nData on the emergence, transmission, and clinical relevance of these new variants are rapidly evolving; \\nthis is especially true for research on how variants might affect transmission rates, disease progression, \\nvaccine development, and the efficacy of current therapeutics. Because the research on variants is \\nmoving quickly and the classification of the different variants may change over time, websites such \\nas the CDC’s COVID Data Tracker, CoVariants.org, and the World Health Organization’s Tracking \\nSARS-CoV-2 Variants provide regular updates on data for SARS-CoV-2 variants. \\nReferences\\n1.

The Panel also defers to the CDC for recommendations \\non the use of testing for screening purposes, such as for screening among people who are asymptomatic but have had \\nrecent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Some key CDC recommendations include:\\n • For diagnosing current SARS-CoV-2 infection, the CDC recommends using either a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) \\nor an antigen test and using a specimen from the upper respiratory tract (e.g., nasal, nasopharyngeal). \\n • There may be a window period of up to 5 days after exposure before viral antigens or nucleic acids can be detected.\\n • NAATs are the most sensitive tests for detecting current SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because antigen tests are less sensitive \\nthan NAATs, the Food and Drug Administration recommends repeating antigen tests that produce negative results in \\ncertain circumstances, such as when clinical suspicion of COVID-19 is high in people who are symptomatic or when \\npeople who are asymptomatic have had known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\\n • Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose current SARS-CoV-2 infection. \\n • Currently, antibody tests are not recommended for assessing SARS-CoV-2 immunity following COVID-19 vaccination or \\nfor assessing the need for vaccination in a person who is unvaccinated.\\nDiagnostic Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Infection\\nFor diagnosing current SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \\nrecommends using either a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or an antigen test.1 Testing may \\nalso be used for screening and to determine the length of a patient’s isolation period.2 There may be a \\nwindow period of up to 5 days after exposure before viral antigens or nucleic acids can be detected.\\nA number of diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., NAATs, antigen tests) have received \\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for use in laboratories \\nand points of care (e.g., physician offices, pharmacies, long-term care facilities, school clinics) and for \\nself-administered testing.3 An influenza and SARS-CoV-2 multiplex NAAT that can simultaneously \\ndetect and differentiate between influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 also received an EUA from \\nthe FDA.4 The FDA also granted authorization to market the first over-the-counter, at-home, molecular \\nNAAT (i.e., Cue COVID-19) and antigen test (i.e., Flowflex COVID-19) for use in people with \\nsymptomatic COVID-19. \\nFor diagnosing current SARS-CoV-2 infection, the CDC recommends using a specimen from the \\nupper respiratory tract (e.g., nasal, nasopharyngeal).5 Testing lower respiratory tract specimens is also \\nan option in certain circumstances (e.g., in those receiving mechanical ventilation). For details about \\ncollecting and handling specimens for COVID-19 testing, please refer to the CDC’s recommendations. \\nAntigen Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Infection\\nAntigen-based diagnostic tests are widely used at home, at the point of care, and in the laboratory because \\nof their low cost, rapid turnaround time, and availability. Antigen tests and laboratory-based NAATs \\nhave similar high specificity. False positive test results can occur with antigen tests, although they are \\nunlikely when the tests are used correctly.6 The likelihood of a false positive antigen test result is higher \\nwhen the expected probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection is low.

Because \\nreinfection can be difficult to distinguish from persistent shedding (i.e., positive NAAT results persisting \\nfor weeks or months), the CDC recommends using an antigen test instead of a NAAT in patients who \\nhave symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are within 90 days of recovering from \\na previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because intermittent detection of viral RNA can occur, a negative \\nresult on an initial NAAT followed by a positive result on a subsequent test does not necessarily mean a \\nperson has been reinfected.11 When the results for an initial and subsequent test are positive, comparative \\nviral sequence data from both tests are needed to distinguish between the persistent presence of viral \\nfragments and reinfection. In the absence of viral sequence data, the cycle threshold (Ct) value from a \\npositive NAAT result may provide information about whether a newly detected infection is related to \\nthe persistence of viral fragments or to reinfection. The Ct value is the number of PCR cycles at which \\nthe nucleic acid target in the sample becomes detectable. In general, the Ct value is inversely related \\nto the SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Because the clinical utility of Ct values is unclear, an expert should be \\nconsulted if these values are used to guide clinical decisions. \\nSerologic or Antibody Testing for Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection\\nUnlike NAATs and antigen tests, which detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2, serologic or antibody tests \\ncan detect recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. The CDC recommends that antibody \\ntests should not be used to diagnose current SARS-CoV-2 infection.12 It may take 21 days or longer after \\nsymptom onset for seroconversion to occur (i.e., the development of detectable immunoglobulin M or \\nimmunoglobulin G antibodies to SARS-CoV-2).13-18 \\nNo serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been approved by the FDA. Some, but not all, commercially \\navailable serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 have received EUAs from the FDA.19 Several professional \\nsocieties and federal agencies, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the CDC, and the \\nFDA, provide guidance on the use of serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2.\\nSerologic Testing and Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 Infection\\nCurrently, antibody tests are not recommended for assessing SARS-CoV-2 immunity following \\nCOVID-19 vaccination or for assessing the need for vaccination in a person who is unvaccinated.\\nThe FDA has issued EUAs for more than 80 SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests since the beginning of the \\npandemic. However, these tests are not currently authorized for routine use in making individual \\nmedical decisions.19 SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests are authorized for detecting antibodies, but their \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Most of these tests are not standardized. \\nFurthermore, as SARS-CoV-2 is not a well-conserved virus, mutations in the receptor binding domain \\nof the virus could lead to decreased binding affinity between antibodies and SARS-CoV-2–specific \\nantigens. \\nIf a serologic test is performed, the result should be interpreted with caution.

Second, \\nsome people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 or who are vaccinated against COVID-19 (e.g., \\nthose who are immunocompromised) may not develop measurable levels of antibodies. It is presumed \\nthat those who do not have measurable antibodies after vaccination are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection than those who have measurable antibodies. Third, because nucleocapsid proteins are not \\na constituent of the vaccines that are currently approved by the FDA, available through EUAs, or in \\nlate-stage clinical trials, serologic tests that detect antibodies by recognizing nucleocapsid proteins \\nshould be used to distinguish between antibody responses to natural infection and vaccine-induced \\nantibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigen.\\nAssuming that the test is reliable, serologic tests that identify recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection \\nmay be used to determine who may be eligible to donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma and may aid \\nin diagnosing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and multisystem inflammatory \\nsyndrome in adults (MIS-A). \\nReferences\\n1.

See Guidelines Development for more information.\\nGeneral Prevention Measures\\nTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily through exposure to respiratory droplets.1 Exposure can \\noccur when individuals inhale droplets or particles that contain the virus or touch mucous membranes \\nwith hands that have been contaminated with the virus. Exhaled droplets or particles can also deposit the \\nvirus onto exposed mucous membranes.\\nThe risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission can be reduced by covering coughs and sneezes, wearing a \\nwell-fitted mask around others, and isolating when experiencing symptoms. Frequent handwashing also \\neffectively reduces the risk of infection.2 Health care providers should follow the Centers for Disease \\nControl and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for infection control and the appropriate use of \\npersonal protective equipment.3 \\nCOVID-19 Vaccines \\nRecommendation\\n• The Panel recommends COVID-19 vaccination for everyone who is eligible according to the \\nCDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (AI).\\nRationale\\nVaccination is the most effective way to prevent COVID-19. Two 2023–2024 mRNA vaccines, \\nBNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and the 2023–2024 recombinant spike \\nprotein with adjuvant vaccine NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax)4 are currently available in the United States. \\nThe adenovirus vector vaccine Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen) is no longer available in the \\nUnited States.\\nCOVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone aged ≥6 months in the United States. The Food \\nand Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization fact sheet and the product label for \\neach vaccine provide detailed information on the vaccination schedule and the doses that are approved \\nor authorized for that vaccine. The type and dose of vaccine and the timing of the doses depend \\non the recipient’s age and underlying medical conditions. The CDC regularly updates the clinical \\nconsiderations for the COVID-19 vaccines currently approved by the FDA or authorized for use in the \\nUnited States.5 \\nAdverse Events\\nCOVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.

In general, adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection can be grouped into the \\nfollowing severity of illness categories; however, the criteria for each category may overlap or vary \\nacross clinical guidelines and clinical trials, and a patient’s clinical status may change over time.\\n• Asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection: Individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 using \\na virologic test (i.e., a nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT] or an antigen test) but have no \\nsymptoms consistent with COVID-19.\\n• Mild illness: Individuals who have any of the various signs and symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g., \\nfever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of taste \\nand smell) but do not have shortness of breath, dyspnea, or abnormal chest imaging.\\n• Moderate illness: Individuals who show evidence of lower respiratory disease during clinical \\nassessment or imaging and who have an oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) \\n≥94% on room air at sea level.\\n• Severe illness: Individuals who have an SpO2 <94% on room air at sea level, a ratio of arterial \\npartial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mm Hg, a respiratory \\nrate >30 breaths/min, or lung infiltrates >50%.\\n• Critical illness: Individuals who have respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ \\ndysfunction.\\nSpO2 is a key parameter for defining the illness categories listed above. However, pulse oximetry has \\nimportant limitations (discussed in more detail below). Clinicians who use SpO2 when assessing a \\npatient must be aware of those limitations and conduct the assessment in the context of that patient’s \\nclinical status.\\nThe risk of progressing to severe disease increases with age and the number of underlying conditions. \\nPatients aged ≥50 years, especially those aged ≥65 years, and patients who are immunosuppressed, \\nunvaccinated, or not up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations are at a higher risk of progressing to severe \\nCOVID-19.1,2 Certain underlying conditions are also associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19, \\nincluding cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, chronic lung \\ndisease, diabetes, advanced or untreated HIV infection, obesity, pregnancy, cigarette smoking, and being \\na recipient of immunosuppressive therapy or a transplant.3 Health care providers should closely monitor \\npatients who have COVID-19 and any of these conditions until clinical recovery is achieved.\\nThe initial evaluation for patients may include chest imaging (e.g., X-ray, ultrasound or computed \\ntomography scan) and an electrocardiogram, if indicated. Laboratory testing should include a complete \\nblood count with differential and a metabolic profile, including liver and renal function tests. Although \\ninflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and ferritin are not routinely \\nmeasured as part of standard care, results from such measurements may have prognostic value.4-7\\nThe definitions for the severity of illness categories also apply to pregnant patients. However, the \\nthreshold for certain interventions is different for pregnant and nonpregnant patients.

In general, leukocyte cell count increases throughout gestation and delivery \\nand peaks during the immediate postpartum period. This increase is mainly due to neutrophilia.9 \\nD-dimer and CRP levels also increase during pregnancy and are often higher in pregnant patients than \\nin nonpregnant patients.10 Detailed information on treating COVID-19 in pregnant patients can be found \\nin Special Considerations During Pregnancy and After Delivery and in the pregnancy considerations \\nsubsections in the Guidelines. \\nIn children with COVID-19, radiographic abnormalities are common and, for the most part, should not \\nbe the only criteria used to determine the severity of illness. The normal values for respiratory rate also \\nvary with age in children. Therefore, hypoxemia should be the primary criterion used to define severe \\nCOVID-19, especially in younger children. In a small subset of children and young adults, SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection may be followed by the severe inflammatory condition multisystem inflammatory syndrome in \\nchildren (MIS-C).11,12 This syndrome is discussed in detail in Special Considerations in Children.\\nClinical Considerations for the Use of Pulse Oximetry\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of pulse oximetry to assess and monitor patients’ oxygenation \\nstatus increased in hospital, outpatient health care facility, and home settings. Although pulse oximetry is \\nuseful for estimating blood oxygen levels, pulse oximeters may not accurately detect hypoxemia under \\ncertain circumstances. To avoid delays in recognizing hypoxemia, clinicians who use pulse oximetry to \\nassist with clinical decisions should keep these limitations in mind.\\nPulse oximetry results can be affected by skin pigmentation, thickness, or temperature. Poor blood \\ncirculation or the use of tobacco or fingernail polish also may affect results. The Food and Drug \\nAdministration (FDA) advises clinicians to refer to the label or manufacturer website of a pulse oximeter \\nor sensor to ascertain its accuracy.13 The FDA also advises using pulse oximetry only as an estimate \\nof blood oxygen saturation, because an SpO2 reading represents a range of arterial oxygen saturation \\n(SaO2). For example, an SpO2 reading of 90% may represent a range of SaO2 from 86% to 94%. \\nStudies that compared SpO2 and SaO2 levels measured before the pandemic found that pulse oximeters \\noverestimated oxygen saturation in people who were classified as having darker skin pigmentation \\nand in people whose race or ethnic origin was reported as non-Hispanic Black, Black, or African \\nAmerican.14,15\\nSeveral published reports have compared SpO2 and SaO2 measurements in patients with COVID-19, \\nincluding children.14,16-18 The studies demonstrated that occult hypoxemia (defined as an SaO2 <88% \\ndespite an SpO2 >92%) was more common in patients with darker skin pigmentation, which may result \\nin adverse consequences. The likelihood of error was greater in the lower ranges of SpO2. In 1 of these \\nstudies, occult hypoxemia was associated with more organ dysfunction and hospital mortality.17 These \\nstudies did not specify the specific devices used to assess SpO2 levels. The FDA has recognized the need \\nfor better real-world evidence to address ongoing concerns about the accuracy of pulse oximeters when \\nthey are used to measure oxygen saturation in people with darker skin pigmentation.19\\nA 5-hospital registry study of patients evaluated in the emergency department or hospitalized for \\nCOVID-19 found that 24% were not identified as eligible for treatment due to overestimation of SaO2.20 \\nThe majority of patients (55%) who were not identified as eligible were Black. The study also examined \\nthe amount of time delay patients experienced before being identified as eligible for treatment. The \\nmedian delay for patients who were Black was 1 hour longer than the delay for patients who were White. \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

One observational study in adults was unable to identify a consistently predictable \\ndifference between SaO2 and SpO2 over time for individual patients.16 Factors other than skin \\npigmentation (e.g., peripheral perfusion, pulse oximeter sensor placement) are likely involved.\\nDespite the limitations of pulse oximetry, an FDA-cleared pulse oximeter for home use can contribute \\nto an assessment of a patient’s overall clinical status. Practitioners should advise patients to follow the \\nmanufacturer’s instructions for use, place the oximeter on the index or ring finger, and ensure the hand is \\nwarm, relaxed, and held below the level of the heart. Fingernail polish should be removed before testing. \\nPatients should be at rest, indoors, and breathing quietly without talking for several minutes before \\ntesting. Rather than accepting the first reading, patients or caretakers should observe the readings on the \\npulse oximeter for ≥30 seconds until a steady number is displayed and inform their health care provider if \\nthe reading is repeatedly below a previously specified value (generally 95% on room air at sea level).13,21 \\nPulse oximetry has been widely adopted as a remote patient monitoring tool, but when the use of pulse \\noximeters is compared with close monitoring of clinical progress via video consultation, telephone calls, \\ntext messaging, or home visits, there is insufficient evidence that it improves clinical outcomes.22,23\\nNot all commercially available pulse oximeters have been cleared by the FDA. SpO2 readings obtained \\nthrough devices not cleared by the FDA, such as over-the-counter sports oximeters or mobile phone \\napplications, lack sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Abnormal readings on these devices should be \\nconfirmed with an FDA-cleared device or an arterial blood gas analysis.24,25\\nRegardless of the setting, SpO2 should always be interpreted within the context of a patient’s entire \\nclinical presentation. Regardless of a pulse oximeter reading, a patient’s signs and symptoms (e.g., \\ndyspnea, tachypnea, chest pain, changes in cognition or attentional state, cyanosis) should be evaluated. \\nAsymptomatic or Presymptomatic Infection\\nAsymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection can occur, although the percentage of patients who remain truly \\nasymptomatic throughout the course of infection is variable and incompletely defined. The percentage \\nof individuals who present with asymptomatic infection and progress to clinical disease is unclear. Some \\nasymptomatic individuals have been reported to have objective radiographic findings consistent with \\nCOVID-19 pneumonia.26,27 \\nMild Illness\\nPatients with mild illness may exhibit a variety of signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, \\nmalaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell). They do not \\nhave shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, or abnormal imaging. Most patients who are mildly ill \\ncan be managed in an ambulatory setting or at home. No imaging or specific laboratory evaluations \\nare routinely indicated in otherwise healthy patients with mild COVID-19. Patients aged ≥50 years, \\nespecially those aged ≥65 years, patients with certain underlying comorbidities, and patients who are \\nimmunosuppressed, unvaccinated, or not up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations are at higher risk \\nof disease progression and are candidates for antiviral therapy.1,2 See Therapeutic Management of \\nNonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for recommendations regarding anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies. \\nModerate Illness\\nModerate illness is defined as evidence of lower respiratory disease during clinical assessment or \\nimaging, with an SpO2 ≥94% on room air at sea level.

However, when these therapies are used appropriately, the benefits outweigh the risks. \\nInfectious complications in patients with COVID-19 can be categorized as follows:\\n• Coinfections at presentation: Although most individuals present with only SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection, concomitant viral infections, including influenza and other respiratory viruses, have \\nbeen reported.28-30 Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia has also been reported, but it is \\nuncommon.28,31,32 Antibacterial therapy is generally not recommended unless additional evidence \\nfor bacterial pneumonia is present (e.g., leukocytosis, the presence of a focal infiltrate on \\nimaging).\\n• Reactivation of latent infections: There are case reports of underlying chronic hepatitis B \\nvirus and latent tuberculosis infections reactivating in patients with COVID-19 who receive \\nimmunomodulators as treatment, although the data are currently limited.33-35 Reactivation of herpes \\nsimplex virus and varicella zoster virus infections have also been reported.36 Cases of severe and \\ndisseminated strongyloidiasis have been reported in patients with COVID-19 during treatment \\nwith tocilizumab and corticosteroids.37,38 Many clinicians would initiate empiric treatment \\n(e.g., with the antiparasitic drug ivermectin), with or without serologic testing, in patients who \\nrequire immunomodulators for the treatment of COVID-19 and have come from areas where \\nStrongyloides is endemic (i.e., tropical, subtropical, or warm temperate areas).39,40\\n• Nosocomial infections: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 may acquire common nosocomial \\ninfections, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia (including ventilator-associated pneumonia), line-\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The majority of mucormycosis \\ncases have been reported in India and are associated with diabetes mellitus or the use of \\ncorticosteroids.47,48 The approach for managing these fungal infections should be the same as the \\napproach for managing invasive fungal infections in other settings. \\nSARS-CoV-2 Reinfection and Breakthrough Infection\\nAs seen with other respiratory viral infections, reinfection after recovery from prior infection has been \\nreported for SARS-CoV-2.49 Reinfection may occur as initial immune responses to the primary infection \\nwane over time. Data regarding the prevalence, risk factors, timing, and severity of reinfection are \\nevolving and vary depending on the circulating variants. Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections (i.e., \\ninfection in people who are up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations) also occur.50 When compared with \\ninfection in people who are unvaccinated, breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals appear less \\nlikely to lead to severe illness or symptoms that persist ≥28 days.50-53 The time to breakthrough infection \\nhas been reported to be shorter for patients with immunocompromising conditions (i.e., solid organ or \\nbone marrow transplant recipients or people with HIV) than for those with no immunocompromising \\nconditions.50\\nAlthough data are limited, no evidence suggests that the treatment of suspected or documented \\nSARS-CoV-2 reinfection or breakthrough infection should be different from the treatment used during \\nthe initial infection, as outlined in Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 \\nand Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19. \\nProlonged Viral Shedding, Persistent Symptoms, and Other Conditions After \\nSARS-CoV-2 Infection\\nSymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically associated with a decline in viral shedding and \\nresolution of COVID-19 symptoms over days to weeks. However, in some cases, reduced viral \\nshedding and symptom resolution are followed by viral or symptom rebound. People who are \\nimmunocompromised may experience viral shedding for many weeks. Some people experience \\nsymptoms that develop or persist for more than 4 weeks after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis. \\nViral or Symptom Rebound Soon After COVID-19\\nObservational studies and results from clinical trials of therapeutic agents have described SARS-CoV-2 \\nviral or COVID-19 symptom rebound in patients who have completed treatment for COVID-19.54-56 \\nViral and symptom rebounds have also occurred when anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies were not used.56,57 \\nTypically, this phenomenon has not been associated with progression to severe COVID-19.\\nProlonged Viral Shedding in Patients Who Are Immunocompromised\\nPatients who are immunocompromised may experience prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 with or \\nwithout COVID-19 symptoms.58,59 Prolonged viral shedding may affect SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies \\nand isolation duration for these patients. In some cases, the prolonged shedding may be associated with \\npersistent COVID-19 symptoms.

However, reports on \\nthese syndromes have several limitations, such as differing case definitions, a lack of comparator groups, \\nand overlap between the reported symptoms and the symptoms of post-intensive care syndrome that have \\nbeen described in patients without COVID-19.

When there are no logistical constraints, clinicians can prescribe therapies \\nto treat SARS-CoV-2 infection to any eligible individual following the recommendations in these \\nGuidelines. \\nIf it is necessary to triage patients for receipt of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, the COVID-19 Treatment \\nGuidelines Panel (the Panel) suggests prioritizing patients based on their clinical risk factors for severe \\ndisease, their vaccination status, and their ability to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 \\nvaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection.\\nPrioritization schemes should include a plan for equitable distribution of scarce resources to individuals \\nwho may have less knowledge of or access to these therapies. The availability and distribution of \\nrecommended therapies should be monitored to ensure that access to products is equitable.\\nPatient Prioritization for Treatment\\nThe Panel recommends using ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) to treat nonhospitalized adults \\n(AIIa) and adolescents (BIII) who have mild to moderate COVID-19 and are at high risk of progressing \\nto severe disease. \\nRemdesivir is a recommended option if ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir cannot be used. However, \\nsome treatment facilities may not have the ability to provide a 3-day course of remdesivir intravenous \\ninfusions to all eligible patients. In these situations, prioritizing patients who will benefit the most from \\nthe therapy becomes necessary. If administration of remdesivir is not feasible, clinicians should review \\nthe Panel’s recommendations in Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 \\nfor alternative treatment options.\\nThe prioritization scheme below is based on 4 key elements: age, vaccination status, immune status, and \\nclinical risk factors. For a list of risk factors, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \\nwebpage Underlying Medical Conditions Associated With Higher Risk for Severe COVID-19. The \\ngroups are listed by tier in descending order of priority. \\n.

Early in the clinical course, the \\ndisease is primarily driven by the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Later in the clinical course, the disease \\nis driven by a dysregulated immune/inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may lead \\nto further tissue damage and thrombosis. Based on this understanding, therapies that directly target \\nSARS-CoV-2 are anticipated to have the greatest effect early in the course of the disease, whereas \\nimmunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic therapies are likely to be more beneficial \\nafter COVID-19 has progressed to stages characterized by hypoxemia, endothelial dysfunction, and \\nimmunothrombosis.\\nThe clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection and \\nmild, moderate, severe, and critical illness.

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel’s (the \\nPanel) recommendations for pharmacologic management can be found in Therapeutic Management of \\nNonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19. \\nThis section focuses on the evaluation and management of: \\n• Adults with COVID-19 in an ambulatory care setting \\n• Adults with COVID-19 following discharge from the emergency department (ED)\\n• Adults with COVID-19 following inpatient discharge\\nOutpatient evaluation and management in each of these settings may include some or all of the \\nfollowing: in-person visits, telemedicine, remote monitoring, and home visits by nurses or other health \\ncare providers.\\nData from studies in the United States show that certain racial and ethnic minorities experience higher \\nrates of COVID-19, hospitalization, and death in relation to their share of the total U.S. population.1-5 \\nIn addition, some studies have found that members of certain racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups \\nwere less likely to receive COVID-19 treatments.6-8 The underlying causes of these observed disparities \\nmay include inadequate insurance coverage, a lack of primary care providers, hesitancy about receiving \\ntreatment, barriers to telehealth visits, and transportation challenges. To reduce COVID-19 treatment \\ndisparities, providers must be aware of the problem and provide patient-centered care.

See Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With \\nCOVID-19 for more information. \\nOlder patients and those with chronic medical conditions, especially those who are not up to date with \\nCOVID-19 vaccinations, have a higher risk of hospitalization and death.17 However, SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection may cause severe disease and death in patients of any age, even in the absence of risk factors. \\nWhen managing older adults with COVID-19, factors such as cognitive impairment, frailty, the risk of \\nfalls, and polypharmacy should be considered. The decision to monitor a patient in the outpatient setting \\nshould be made on a case-by-case basis. \\nClinical Considerations When Managing Patients in an Ambulatory Care Setting\\nPatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic or experience symptoms that are \\nindistinguishable from other acute viral or bacterial infections (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, \\nmuscle pain, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms). People who have symptoms compatible with \\nCOVID-19 should undergo diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing (see Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Infection). \\nConsidering other possible etiologies of symptoms is important, including other respiratory viral \\ninfections (e.g., influenza), community-acquired pneumonia, congestive heart failure, asthma or chronic \\nobstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, and streptococcal pharyngitis.\\nAlthough mild dyspnea is common, worsening dyspnea and severe chest pain or tightness suggest the \\ndevelopment or progression of pulmonary involvement. In earlier studies of patients with COVID-19 \\nwho developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, progression occurred a median of 2.5 days after \\nthe onset of dyspnea.18-20 Patients with persistent or progressive dyspnea, especially those who have an \\noxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) ≤94% on room air at sea level or have symptoms \\nthat suggest high acuity (e.g., chest pain or tightness, dizziness, confusion, other mental status changes), \\nshould be referred to a health care provider for an in-person evaluation (AIII).\\nIf an adult patient has access to a pulse oximeter at home, SpO2 measurements can be used to help \\nassess overall clinical status. Patients should be advised to use pulse oximeters on warm fingers rather \\nthan cold fingers for better accuracy. Patients should inform their health care providers if the value is \\nrepeatedly below 95% on room air at sea level. Pulse oximetry may not accurately detect hypoxemia, \\nespecially in patients who have dark skin pigmentation.21,22 \\nNot all commercially available pulse oximeters have been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration \\n(FDA). SpO2 readings obtained through non-FDA-cleared devices, such as over-the-counter sports \\noximeters or mobile phone applications, lack sufficient accuracy for clinical use.23,24 Abnormal readings \\non these devices should be confirmed with an FDA-cleared device or an arterial blood gas analysis. \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

See Clinical Spectrum \\nof SARS-CoV-2 Infection for more information.\\nThe criteria used to determine the appropriate clinical setting for an in-person evaluation may vary by \\nlocation and institution. There should be a low threshold for in-person evaluation of older people and \\nthose with medical conditions associated with an increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. \\nThe individuals who perform the initial triage should use their clinical judgment to determine whether \\npatients require ambulance transport. \\nIn some settings where clinical evaluation is challenged by geography, home visits from a health care \\nprovider may be used to evaluate patients.26 Patients who are homeless should be provided with housing \\nwhere they can adequately self-isolate. All outpatients should receive instructions regarding self-care, \\nisolation, and follow-up, and they should be advised to contact a health care provider or a local ED \\nabout any worsening symptoms.27\\nCounseling Regarding the Need for Follow-Up\\nClinicians should ensure that these patients receive adequate medical follow-up. The frequency and \\nduration of follow-up will depend on the risk for severe disease, the severity of symptoms, and the \\npatient’s ability to self-report worsening symptoms. Health care providers should determine whether \\na patient has adequate transportation for clinic visits; whether they have access to a phone, computer, \\nor tablet for telehealth visits; and whether they have regular access to food. The clinician should also \\nconfirm that the patient has a caregiver who can assist with daily activities if needed. \\nAll patients and/or their family members or caregivers should be counseled about the warning symptoms \\nthat should prompt re-evaluation through a telehealth visit or an in-person evaluation in an ambulatory \\ncare setting or ED. These symptoms include new onset of dyspnea; worsening dyspnea (particularly \\nif dyspnea occurs while resting or if it interferes with daily activities); dizziness; and mental status \\nchanges, such as confusion. \\nManaging Adults With COVID-19 Following Discharge From the Emergency \\nDepartment\\nClinicians who work in EDs should assess whether a patient requires hospital admission for the \\nmanagement of COVID-19 or whether the symptoms can be managed in the outpatient setting. \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Whether an in-person or telehealth visit is most appropriate depends \\non the clinical and social situation. In some cases, adult patients are deemed to be stable for discharge \\nfrom the inpatient setting while they still require supplemental oxygen. When possible, these individuals \\nshould receive oximetry monitoring and close follow-up through telehealth visits, visiting nurse \\nservices, or in-person clinic visits. \\nThe Panel recommends against routinely continuing venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients \\nwith COVID-19 after hospital discharge unless they have another indication for anticoagulation (AIIa). \\nFor more information, see Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients With COVID-19. Patients should be \\nencouraged to ambulate, and activity should be increased according to the patient’s tolerance.\\nConsiderations in Pregnant People\\nManaging pregnant outpatients with COVID-19 is similar to managing nonpregnant patients. Clinicians \\nshould offer supportive care and therapeutics as indicated, take steps to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 \\ntransmission, and provide guidance on when to seek an in-person evaluation. Pregnant patients who \\nhave COVID-19 are at higher risk of severe disease, including a higher risk of death, intensive care unit \\nadmission, and mechanical ventilation, than nonpregnant people with COVID-19.28,29 Pregnant patients \\nwith COVID-19 also have an increased risk of poor obstetric and neonatal outcomes, and this risk may \\nbe even higher in people with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and lung disease.30-\\n34 It is important for health care providers to thoroughly assess pregnant patients for potential risks of \\nsevere COVID-19 and offer antiviral therapy when indicated. Please see Special Considerations During \\nPregnancy and After Delivery for more information on managing pregnant patients with COVID-19. \\nIn pregnant patients, SpO2 should be maintained at ≥95% on room air at sea level; therefore, the \\nthreshold for monitoring pregnant patients in an inpatient setting may be lower than in nonpregnant \\npatients. At this time, there are no changes to fetal monitoring recommendations in the outpatient setting, \\nand fetal surveillance and management should be similar to the fetal surveillance and management used \\nfor pregnant patients with medical illness.35,36 However, these monitoring strategies can be discussed on \\na case-by-case basis with an obstetrician. Pregnant and lactating patients should be given the opportunity \\nto participate in clinical trials of outpatients with COVID-19 to help inform decision making in this \\npopulation. \\nReferences\\n1.

For adults who are at high risk of progressing to severe disease, several antiviral therapeutic \\noptions are available to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death. The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines \\nPanel’s (the Panel) recommendations on the use of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are \\noutlined in this section. \\nThe main goal of therapeutic management for nonhospitalized patients is to prevent progression to \\nsevere disease, hospitalization, or death. Other goals may include accelerating symptom recovery and \\nviral clearance and preventing long-term sequelae. Current data on the impact of therapy on these \\nsecondary goals are limited. \\nSeveral factors affect the selection of the best treatment option for a specific patient. These factors \\ninclude the clinical efficacy and availability of the treatment option, the feasibility of administering \\nparenteral medications, the potential for significant drug-drug interactions, the patient’s pregnancy \\nstatus, the time from symptom onset, and the in vitro activities of the available products against the \\ncurrently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants. \\nMost of the data that support the use of the recommended treatment options come from clinical trials \\nthat enrolled individuals who were at high risk of disease progression and who had no pre-existing \\nimmunity from COVID-19 vaccination or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accordingly, the proportion \\nof hospitalizations and deaths in the placebo arms of these trials was high compared to what has been \\nseen more recently in populations where most people are vaccinated or have had prior SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection. Although these trials demonstrated the efficacy of using antiviral drugs in high-risk \\npopulations, it is difficult to know their precise effectiveness in the current setting because of the low \\nrates of hospitalization and death among those who have been vaccinated. \\nNevertheless, some patients continue to have an increased risk of disease progression, and it is in \\nthose people that therapies are most likely to be beneficial. Patients who are at the highest risk are \\nolder patients (i.e., those aged >50 years and especially those aged ≥65 years) and patients who are \\nunlikely to have an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccines due to a moderate to severe \\nimmunocompromising condition or the receipt of immunosuppressive medications. Other risk factors \\ninclude lack of vaccination or incomplete vaccination; a prolonged amount of time since the most recent \\nvaccine dose (e.g., >6 months); and conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary, cardiac, \\nor renal disease.1 \\nPeople who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups have higher rates of hospitalization and \\ndeath from COVID-19 than people who are White.2 Disparities in the use of antiviral treatments in \\npatients who are not White have been reported; therefore, attention to equitable access is critical.3,4\\nThe Panel’s recommendations reflect the available data on the benefits of using antiviral therapies \\nto prevent progression to severe COVID-19.

For more information, see General Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With Acute \\nCOVID-19.\\nRationale for the Panel’s Recommendations\\nThe Panel’s recommendations for the antiviral agents that are used to treat nonhospitalized patients with \\nmild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of disease progression are based on the results of clinical \\ntrials. \\nThe Panel favors the use of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) in most high-risk, nonhospitalized \\npatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. When ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is not clinically \\nappropriate (e.g., because of significant drug-drug interactions), the Panel recommends using remdesivir. \\nRitonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir has high efficacy; has been shown to reduce hospitalization and death when \\nadministered to high-risk, unvaccinated, nonhospitalized patients within 5 days of symptom onset;5 and is \\nan oral medication, whereas remdesivir requires intravenous (IV) administration. \\nThe Panel’s recommendation for remdesivir is based on the results from a Phase 3, randomized, \\nplacebo-controlled trial that reported high clinical efficacy for remdesivir in high-risk, nonhospitalized \\npatients with COVID-19 who were unvaccinated.6 However, in some settings, daily IV administration of \\nremdesivir for 3 days may be a logistical challenge. \\nThe Panel recommends molnupiravir as a therapeutic option when the other recommended antiviral \\ntreatment options are not available, feasible to use, or clinically appropriate (CIIa). Molnupiravir appears \\nto have lower clinical efficacy than the other treatment options, although no randomized studies have \\ncompared these therapies directly.\\nThere is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against initiating these antiviral \\nagents after the recommended timeframes. Because the drugs listed above were studied soon after \\nsymptom onset (i.e., within 5 days for molnupiravir and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and within 7 days \\nfor remdesivir), it is not known whether they would confer a clinical benefit if they were started beyond \\nthe recommended timeframe.\\nCurrently, data on the use of combinations of antiviral agents for the treatment of COVID-19 are limited. \\nClinical trials are needed to determine whether combination therapy has a role in the treatment of COVID-19. \\nStrategies for the Use of Ritonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir\\nBecause ritonavir is a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, it may \\nincrease blood concentrations of certain concomitant medications and increase the potential for serious \\ndrug toxicities.

If a \\nsignificant drug-drug interaction is identified, prescribers should consider consulting with a pharmacist. \\nThe following resources provide information on identifying and managing drug-drug interactions:\\n• Drug-Drug Interactions Between Ritonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and Concomitant \\nMedications\\n• The Liverpool COVID-19 Drug Interactions website\\n• The University of Waterloo/University of Toronto drug interaction guide for ritonavir-boosted \\nnirmatrelvir\\n• The FDA prescribing information for ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir\\nThe use of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir may be challenging in patients with severe renal impairment. \\nThe FDA prescribing information states that ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is not recommended for \\npatients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <30 mL/min until more data are available \\nto establish appropriate dosing.7 Although data on dose adjustments are limited, some groups have \\nproposed dosing adjustments for ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir in patients with an eGFR of <30 mL/min \\nor in patients who require hemodialysis.8-11 \\nThe decision to prescribe ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir to patients who have received transplants \\nand are taking calcineurin and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors should always be made in \\nconsultation with the patient’s specialist providers. Among reports submitted to the FDA Adverse \\nEvent Reporting System, the most commonly reported concomitant medications that resulted in serious \\nadverse reactions, including fatal events, were calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus).12 Ritonavir-\\nboosted nirmatrelvir may be prescribed to select patients if an expert in managing the interaction \\nis available and close therapeutic drug monitoring is logistically feasible. Otherwise, an alternative \\ntherapy for COVID-19 should be considered. See the American Society of Transplantation statement for \\nadditional information. \\nInteractions between ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and cancer chemotherapeutic agents should also \\nbe managed in consultation with the patient’s specialist providers. For guidance on managing these \\ninteractions, refer to the FDA prescribing information for ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and the \\nprescribing information for the chemotherapeutic agent. The University Health Network/Kingston \\nHealth Sciences Centre provides an additional resource for evaluating drug-drug interactions between \\nritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and chemotherapeutic agents.\\nStrategies for the Use of Remdesivir\\nAdvanced planning (e.g., reserving infusion slots, identifying alternative infusion sites) may be needed \\nto increase access to IV remdesivir. IV remdesivir can be administered in skilled nursing facilities, home \\nhealth care settings, and outpatient facilities such as infusion centers. If treatment facilities cannot provide \\na 3-day course of remdesivir IV infusions to all eligible patients, prioritizing patients who will benefit the \\nmost from the therapy becomes necessary. The prioritization scheme below is based on 4 key elements: \\nage, vaccination status, immune status, and clinical risk factors.

In the PINETREE trial, \\nnonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were unvaccinated and at high risk \\nof progressing to severe disease received 3 days of IV remdesivir or placebo. The use of remdesivir \\nresulted in an 87% relative reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death.6 \\nRemdesivir should be administered in a setting where severe hypersensitivity reactions, such as \\nanaphylaxis, can be managed. Patients should be monitored during the infusion and observed for at least \\n1 hour after the infusion as clinically appropriate.\\nFor more information, see Remdesivir.  \\nAdditional Information on Molnupiravir \\nMolnupiravir is the oral prodrug of beta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine, a ribonucleoside that has shown \\nantiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in clinical trials.22-24 The FDA issued an Emergency \\nUse Authorization for molnupiravir for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in nonhospitalized \\npatients aged ≥18 years who are at high risk of disease progression and for whom other antiviral \\ntreatment options are not accessible or clinically appropriate. \\nThe MOVe-OUT trial enrolled high-risk, unvaccinated, nonhospitalized adults in the pre-Omicron era.21 \\nThe study found that molnupiravir reduced the rate of hospitalization or death by 31% compared to \\nplacebo. A secondary analysis of patients who required hospitalization during the trial found a reduced \\nneed for respiratory interventions among those who received molnupiravir compared to those who \\nreceived placebo.25 \\nThe PANORAMIC trial enrolled nonhospitalized adults with COVID-19 who were at high risk of severe \\ndisease during a period when the Omicron variant was circulating.26 Ninety-four percent of the patients \\nhad received at least 3 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. The study found that the use of molnupiravir plus \\nusual care did not reduce the occurrence of the primary composite outcome of hospitalization or death \\ncompared to usual care alone.

People who engage in \\nsexual activity that may result in conception should use effective contraception during and following \\ntreatment with molnupiravir. \\nFetal toxicity has been reported in animal studies of molnupiravir.27 However, when other therapies \\nare not available, pregnant patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of progressing to severe \\ndisease may reasonably choose molnupiravir after being fully informed of the risks, particularly if \\nthey are beyond the time of embryogenesis (i.e., >10 weeks’ gestation). See Pregnancy, Lactation, and \\nCOVID-19 Therapeutics for more information.\\nFor more information, see Molnupiravir. \\nViral Rebound and Symptom Recurrence\\nObservational studies and the EPIC-HR and MOVe-OUT trials have described SARS-CoV-2 viral \\nrebound and the recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms in some patients who have completed treatment \\nwith ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir or molnupiravir.7,27-30 However, viral rebound can also occur in \\npatients who have not received treatment for COVID-19.31 Some observational studies have reported \\nthat patients who were treated with ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir had a higher frequency of viral \\nrebound and symptom recurrence than those who did not receive treatment.32,33 The re-emergence of \\nculturable SARS CoV-2 has been reported in some individuals with viral rebound. \\nTo date, virus detection and the recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms following the use of antiviral \\ntherapies have not been associated with progression to severe COVID-19.34,35 Therefore, concerns about \\nviral rebound or the recurrence of symptoms should not be a reason to avoid using antiviral therapies \\nwhen their use is indicated.27,36-38 There are insufficient data on whether a longer course of ritonavir-\\nboosted nirmatrelvir or molnupiravir will prevent viral rebound or symptom recurrence. There also \\nare insufficient data on the efficacy of administering a second course of antiviral therapy to treat viral \\nrebound or symptom recurrence. However, a clinical trial that is evaluating the use of a second course of \\nritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir to treat patients with viral rebound and symptom recurrence is underway \\n(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT05567952).\\nImmunomodulators \\nThe Panel recommends against the use of dexamethasone or other systemic corticosteroids to treat \\noutpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization or supplemental \\noxygen (AIIb).

Early in the clinical course, the \\ndisease is primarily driven by the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Later in the clinical course, the disease \\nis driven by a dysregulated immune/inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may lead \\nto further tissue damage and thrombosis. Based on this understanding, therapies that directly target \\nSARS-CoV-2 are anticipated to have the greatest effect early in the course of the disease, whereas \\nimmunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic therapies are likely to be more beneficial \\nafter COVID-19 has progressed to stages characterized by hypoxemia, endothelial dysfunction, and \\nimmunothrombosis. \\nCurrently, most people in the United States have some degree of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 due to \\nCOVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. The increase in population immunity and the change \\nin variants have led to a decrease in the rate of severe disease caused by COVID-19.  Because other \\nco-existing diseases can cause hypoxemia in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, \\nclinicians should perform the appropriate evaluations to rule out alternative diagnoses. However, \\nthe ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to immune escape, allowing the virus to continue \\ncirculating in the community. Thus, COVID-19 remains a concern for public health. \\nMany of the patients who are hospitalized for COVID-19 are immunocompromised to some degree. \\nFor most hospitalized patients with severe or critical COVID-19 who are immunocompromised, \\nthe COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends using antiviral drugs and \\nimmunomodulatory therapies at the doses and durations recommended for the general population (AIII). \\nSome patients who are immunocompromised have prolonged COVID-19 symptoms and evidence of \\nongoing SARS-CoV-2 replication.

The Panel’s \\nrecommendations for these patients are the same as those for nonhospitalized patients (see Therapeutic \\nManagement of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19).\\nPatients Who Are Hospitalized for COVID-19 and Who Do Not Require \\nSupplemental Oxygen\\nRecommendations\\n• The Panel recommends using remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients \\nwho do not require supplemental oxygen and who are immunocompromised (BIIb) and for other \\npatients who are at high risk of progressing to severe disease (BIII). \\n• Remdesivir should be administered for 5 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first.\\nThe rationale for using remdesivir in high-risk patients is based on several lines of evidence. In a \\ntrial conducted predominantly among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were not receiving \\nsupplemental oxygen at enrollment, a 5-day course of remdesivir was associated with greater clinical \\nimprovement when compared with standard of care.1 Evidence from the PINETREE trial also suggests that \\nearly therapy reduces the risk of progression, although that study was performed in high-risk, unvaccinated, \\nnonhospitalized patients with ≤7 days of symptoms who received a 3-day course of remdesivir.2 \\nOther studies have not shown a clinical benefit of remdesivir in this group of patients. In the ACTT-1 \\ntrial, remdesivir showed no significant benefit in hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19; \\nhowever, only 13% of the study population did not require supplemental oxygen.3 In the large Solidarity \\ntrial, the use of remdesivir was not associated with a survival benefit among the subset of hospitalized \\npatients who did not require supplemental oxygen.4 See Table 4a for more information. \\nThe aggregate data on using remdesivir to treat all high-risk patients with COVID-19 show a faster time \\nto recovery in patients who received remdesivir but no clear evidence of a survival benefit. Therefore, \\nthe Panel recommends using remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who do not require \\nsupplemental oxygen and who are at high risk of progressing to severe disease (BIII). \\nIn a large, retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were \\nimmunocompromised (n = 28,338), patients who received remdesivir had a lower risk of mortality \\nthan those who did not receive remdesivir.5 Forty percent of patients in this cohort were not receiving \\nsupplemental oxygen at baseline; mortality was reduced in this subset of patients. Therefore, the Panel \\nrecommends using remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who do not require supplemental \\noxygen and who are immunocompromised (BIIb).\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

See Table 5a for more information about the \\nclinical trials that have evaluated the use of these drugs in patients with COVID-19. Patients who are \\nreceiving corticosteroid treatment for an underlying condition should continue to receive corticosteroids.\\nPatients Who Require Conventional Oxygen \\nPatients with COVID-19 who require conventional oxygen (i.e., those who do not require high-flow \\nnasal cannula [HFNC] oxygen, noninvasive ventilation [NIV], or mechanical ventilation) are a \\nheterogeneous population. Although all patients who require oxygen are considered to have severe \\ndisease, some of these patients will improve after a short period with or without treatment; others will \\ndevelop progressive disease. There is no consensus on which clinical or laboratory parameters should be \\nused to determine a patient’s risk of progression and guide therapy. \\nRecommendation\\n• For patients with COVID-19 who only require minimal conventional oxygen, the Panel \\nrecommends using remdesivir without dexamethasone (BIIa).\\nIn a subgroup analysis during the ACTT-1 trial, remdesivir significantly reduced the time to clinical \\nrecovery and significantly reduced mortality among the subset of patients who were receiving \\nconventional oxygen at enrollment.3 Evidence from ACTT-1 and a pooled analysis of individual \\ndata from 9 randomized controlled trials8 suggest that remdesivir will have its greatest benefit when \\nadministered early in the clinical course of COVID-19 (e.g., within 10 days of symptom onset).

After \\nreviewing these clinical trial results, the Panel recommends baricitinib over tocilizumab as the second \\nimmunomodulator. See Table 5c and Table 5d for more information.

This discussion includes examples of patients who may benefit most from \\nreceiving remdesivir. In addition, clinicians may extend the course of remdesivir beyond 5 days in this \\npopulation based on clinical response.\\nPatients Who Are Immunocompromised \\nPeople who are immunocompromised already have difficulty achieving viral clearance. The use \\nof immunomodulators to treat COVID-19 may further impair this process. Because SARS-CoV-2 \\nreplication may be prolonged in these patients, remdesivir may help enhance viral clearance and improve \\noutcomes. In a large, retrospective study of a cohort of patients who were immunocompromised, patients \\nwho received remdesivir had a lower risk of mortality than those who did not receive remdesivir; \\nhowever, only 19% of the patients in the study were receiving HFNC oxygen or NIV .5 For more \\ninformation, see Special Considerations in People Who Are Immunocompromised.\\nPatients With Evidence of Ongoing Viral Replication \\nHospitalized patients who require HFNC oxygen or NIV are routinely treated with 2 immunomodulators \\nto prevent or mitigate inflammation-mediated injury. These treatments may impair the patient’s ability to \\nachieve viral clearance; thus, directly treating the virus with remdesivir may theoretically help improve \\noutcomes. Substantial evidence from studies of other viral diseases supports the benefits of reducing the \\nviral burden. Ct values can be obtained from some SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays, and these values may \\nbe used as a proxy for the level of ongoing viral replication (low Ct values correspond to higher viral \\nloads). While this information is not available on all RT-PCR platforms, Ct values may be helpful in \\ninforming decisions regarding the use of remdesivir. Positive rapid antigen test results are also consistent \\nwith higher viral loads.27 \\nPatients Who Are Within 10 Days of Symptom Onset  \\nActive viral replication occurs early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence from the ACTT-1 \\nand PINETREE trials suggests that remdesivir will have the greatest benefit when administered early \\nin the clinical course of COVID-19.2,3 In the ACTT-1 trial, remdesivir demonstrated a greater benefit in \\npatients who were enrolled within 10 days of symptom onset than in those who were enrolled later in the \\ndisease course.  \\nUse of Anticoagulants \\n• The Panel recommends using a prophylactic dose of heparin as VTE prophylaxis, unless a \\ncontraindication exists (AI); (BIII) for pregnant patients.\\n• The Panel recommends against the use of a therapeutic dose of anticoagulation for VTE \\nprophylaxis (BI).\\n• For patients who start on a therapeutic dose of heparin in a non-ICU setting due to COVID-19 \\nand then transfer to the ICU, the Panel recommends switching from the therapeutic dose to a \\nprophylactic dose of heparin, unless VTE is confirmed (BIII). \\nThe multiplatform randomized controlled trial REMAP-CAP/ACTIV-4a/ATTACC compared the \\neffectiveness of a therapeutic dose of heparin to standard care in critically ill patients with COVID-19.28 \\nThe study did not show an increase in the number of organ support-free days or the probability of \\nsurvival to hospital discharge among patients who received therapeutic doses of anticoagulation.

In this case, the rationale to add remdesivir is \\nbased on the observed clinical benefit of remdesivir during earlier stages of infection, the results of the \\nobservational study, and the demonstrated safety of remdesivir. In addition, some Panel members would \\nadd remdesivir to the regimen for patients with COVID-19 who are immunocompromised, who have \\nevidence for ongoing viral replication, or who are within 10 days of symptom onset.\\nUse of Anticoagulants \\n• The Panel recommends using a prophylactic dose of heparin as VTE prophylaxis, unless a \\ncontraindication exists (AI); (BIII) for pregnant patients.\\n• For patients who start on a therapeutic dose of heparin in a non-ICU setting due to COVID-19 \\nand then transfer to the ICU, the Panel recommends switching from the therapeutic dose to a \\nprophylactic dose of heparin, unless there is another indication for therapeutic anticoagulation \\n(BIII). \\n• The Panel recommends against the use of a therapeutic dose of anticoagulation for VTE \\nprophylaxis (BI).\\nPatients who required mechanical ventilation or ECMO were included in the multiplatform \\nREMAP-CAP/ACTIV-4a/ATTACC trial that studied therapeutic doses of heparin.28 Because these \\nstudies reported no benefits of using therapeutic doses of heparin, the recommendations for using \\nprophylactic doses of heparin in hospitalized patients who require mechanical ventilation or ECMO are \\nthe same as those for patients who require HFNC oxygen or NIV .\\nTable 2d.

Although only a small percentage of children with COVID-19 will \\nrequire medical attention, the percentage of intensive care unit admissions among hospitalized children \\nis comparable to that for hospitalized adults with COVID-19.6,10-18\\nObservational studies and meta-analyses have found that children with certain comorbidities are at \\nincreased risk of severe COVID-19. These comorbidities include cardiac disease, neurologic disorders, \\nprematurity (in young infants), diabetes, obesity (particularly severe obesity), chronic lung disease, \\nfeeding tube dependence, and immunocompromised status.19-22 Demographic factors, such as age (<1 \\nyear and 10–14 years)23 and non-White race/ethnicity,15,24-26 have also been associated with severe \\ndisease. However, many studies did not assess the relative severity of underlying medical conditions in \\nchildren with severe COVID-19. \\nIn general, COVID-19 has similar clinical manifestations and disease stages in children and adults, \\nincluding an early phase driven by viral replication and a late phase that appears to be driven by a \\ndysregulated immune/inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 that leads to tissue damage. Respiratory \\ncomplications in young children that can occur during the early clinical phase include croup and \\nbronchiolitis. In addition, a small number of children who have recovered from acute SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) 2 to 6 weeks after infection. \\nMIS-C is a postinfectious inflammatory condition that can lead to severe organ dysfunction.\\nPublished guidance on the treatment of COVID-19 in children has been extrapolated mostly from \\nrecommendations for adults with COVID-19, recommendations for children with other viral infections, \\nand expert opinion.27-29 Applying adult data from COVID-19 trials to children is a unique challenge \\nbecause most children experience a mild course of illness with COVID-19.30 Relative to adults, children \\nwith COVID-19 have substantially lower mortality and less need for hospitalization.10,11,31 Because \\nof these differences in epidemiology and disease severity, the effect sizes of treatments for children \\nare likely to be smaller than those observed in adults. Therefore, to produce a beneficial outcome in \\nchildren, the number needed to treat is higher. Collectively, these factors influence the risk versus benefit \\nbalance for pharmacologic therapies in children. \\nIn the absence of sufficient clinical trial data on the treatment of children with COVID-19, the \\nCOVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel’s (the Panel) recommendations for the therapeutic management \\nof hospitalized children are based largely on safety and efficacy data from clinical trials in adults, the \\nchild’s risk of disease progression, and expert opinion.\\nIn general, data from clinical trials in adults are most applicable to the treatment of older children \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Throughout this section, the term “COVID-19” \\nrefers to the acute, primarily respiratory illness due to infection with SARS-CoV-2. MIS-C refers to the \\npostinfectious inflammatory condition.\\nEpidemiology\\nData from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) demonstrate that severe disease and \\ndeath due to COVID-19 occur less often in children than in adults.1-4 However, weekly hospitalization \\nrates for children aged <6 months are high, exceeded only by the rates for adults aged ≥75 years.5 The \\noverall incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and, by extension, COVID-19–related hospitalizations \\namong children increased substantially with the emergence of newer variants, particularly the Omicron \\nvariant and its subvariants.6,7 According to the CDC, by December 2022, an estimated 96% of children \\nand adolescents had serologic evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.8 The high infection rate among \\nchildren makes the overall burden substantial despite the low rate of severe outcomes.9\\nData on the pathogenesis and clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are still limited \\ncompared to the data for adults. Although only a small percentage of children with COVID-19 will \\nrequire medical attention, the percentage of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions among hospitalized \\nchildren is comparable to that for hospitalized adults with COVID-19.6,10-18\\nChildren from some racial and ethnic groups experience disproportionate rates of COVID-19–related \\nhospitalization, which may be a result of barriers to accessing health care and economic and structural \\ninequities.

However, a greater proportion of children may be asymptomatic or have only mild illness \\nwhen compared with adults. Although the true incidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is \\nunknown, a small study reported that 45% of children who underwent surveillance testing at the time \\nof hospitalization for a non–COVID-19 indication had asymptomatic infection.22 The most common \\nsigns and symptoms of COVID-19 in hospitalized children are fever, nausea/vomiting, cough, shortness \\nof breath, and upper respiratory symptoms.15,23 The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may overlap \\nsignificantly with those of influenza and other respiratory and enteric viral infections. Critical disease, \\nincluding respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and, less commonly, shock, may occur \\nin children with COVID-19.24,25 For more information, see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized \\nChildren With COVID-19 and Introduction to Critical Care Management of Children With COVID-19.\\nRisk Factors for Severe COVID-19\\nObservational studies and meta-analyses have found that children with certain comorbidities are at \\nincreased risk of severe COVID-19. These comorbidities include cardiac disease, neurologic disorders, \\nprematurity (in young infants), diabetes, obesity (particularly severe obesity), chronic lung disease, \\nfeeding tube dependence, and immunocompromised status.26-29 Demographic factors, such as age (<1 \\nyear and 10–14 years)30 and non-White race/ethnicity,15,19-21 have also been associated with severe \\ndisease. However, many studies did not assess the relative severity of underlying medical conditions in \\nchildren with severe COVID-19. \\nMany published studies reported an increased relative risk of severe disease in children with \\ncomorbidities,20,26-30 but the overall risk of severe COVID-19 among children remains low. Protocolized \\nadmissions for certain populations (e.g., febrile young infants) may confound the association between \\ncomorbidities and severe COVID-19. However, nearly half of the children aged 8 months to <5 years \\nwho were hospitalized for COVID-19 from September 20, 2022, to May 31, 2023, were previously \\nhealthy.31 Most children who have been hospitalized for severe COVID-19 have not been fully \\nvaccinated, as many were not eligible for COVID-19 vaccination because of their age when the studies \\nwere conducted.5 The CDC has additional information on the underlying conditions that are risk factors \\nfor severe COVID-19. \\nThe risk of severe disease is an important factor to consider when making treatment decisions for \\nchildren with COVID-19. The children most likely to benefit from antiviral treatment are those who \\nare nonhospitalized, have mild to moderate COVID-19, and are at the highest risk of severe COVID-19 \\n(e.g., those with severe comorbidities).

Although the case \\ndefinitions for these syndromes differ slightly, they are likely the same disease. The syndrome was \\nfirst described in Europe, where previously healthy children with severe inflammation and features \\nsimilar to Kawasaki disease were identified as having current or recent infection with SARS-CoV-2.57,58 \\nSubsequently, children with MIS-C were identified in the United States and in many other locations \\noutside of Europe.59 Most patients with MIS-C have serologic evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection, but only a minority have had a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction \\n(RT-PCR) result for SARS-CoV-2 at presentation.60,61 The peak, population-based incidence of MIS-C \\nlags about 4 weeks behind the peak of acute pediatric COVID-19–related hospitalizations.\\nAlthough risk factors for the development of MIS-C have not been established, an analysis of MIS-C \\ncases in the United States found that ICU admission was more likely for patients aged 6 to 12 years than \\nfor younger children, and it was more likely for children who identified as non-Hispanic Black than for \\nthose who identified as non-Hispanic White.62 Unlike most children who present with severe COVID-19, \\nthe majority of children who present with MIS-C do not seem to have common underlying comorbidities \\nother than obesity.62 In addition, children whose deaths were related to MIS-C were less likely to have \\nunderlying medical conditions than children who died of COVID-19.42 \\nSeveral studies have suggested that COVID-19 vaccination protects against the development of \\nMIS-C.63-65 Following the emergence of the Omicron variant, the incidence of MIS-C and the clinical \\nseverity of MIS-C have declined.66-70 This decline may be a result of several factors.

The data on \\nthe incidence of post-COVID conditions in children are limited and somewhat conflicting, but the \\noverall incidence appears to be lower in children than in adults (see Clinical Spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 \\nInfection).85-92 \\nCase definitions for post-COVID conditions vary between studies, which makes determining the true \\nincidence of these conditions challenging. The incidence of post-COVID symptoms in children appears \\nto increase with age. The most common symptoms reported include persistent fatigue, headache, \\nshortness of breath, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal symptoms, and an altered sense of smell.93 \\nCardiopulmonary injury, neurocognitive impairment, and new-onset diabetes may occur.

The CDC provides additional information about the incidence, \\npresentation, and management strategies for post-COVID conditions in children as well as adults. \\nAdditional research is needed to define the incidence, pathophysiology, spectrum, and severity of \\npost-COVID conditions in children and to identify the optimal strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, \\nand treatment of these conditions.\\nReferences\\n1.

These recommendations are also for children who have mild to moderate \\nCOVID-19 and are hospitalized for reasons other than COVID-19. For patients aged ≥18 years, see \\nTherapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19. Throughout this section, the term \\n“COVID-19” refers to the acute, primarily respiratory illness due to infection with SARS-CoV-2. For the \\nPanel’s recommendations for managing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), see \\nTherapeutic Management of Hospitalized Children With MIS-C, Plus a Discussion on MIS-A. \\nTreatment Considerations\\nCurrently, no results from pediatric clinical trials that evaluated the treatment of COVID-19 have been \\npublished. Data evaluating the use of pharmacologic therapy in children with COVID-19 are limited \\nlargely to descriptive reports.1-3 Therefore, more high-quality randomized trials, observational studies, \\nand pharmacokinetic studies are urgently needed. Whenever possible, clinical trials of therapeutics and \\nmulticenter observational cohorts should enroll children with COVID-19. \\nPublished guidance on the treatment of COVID-19 in children has been extrapolated mostly from \\nrecommendations for adults with COVID-19, recommendations for children with other viral infections, \\nand expert opinion.4-6 Applying adult data from COVID-19 trials to children is a unique challenge \\nbecause most children experience a mild course of illness with COVID-19. Relative to adults, children \\nwith COVID-19 have substantially lower mortality and less need for hospitalization.7-9 Because of these \\ndifferences in epidemiology and disease severity, the effect sizes of treatments for children are likely \\nto be smaller than those observed in adults. Therefore, to produce a beneficial outcome in children, the \\nnumber needed to treat is higher. Collectively, these factors influence the risk versus benefit balance for \\npharmacologic therapies in children. \\nOther challenges are the uncertainty about which comorbid conditions place children at the highest \\nrisk of severe COVID-19 and the uncertainty about the absolute magnitude of the increased risk from \\nthose comorbid conditions. For children with COVID-19, the type, number, and severity of comorbid \\nconditions influence decisions about pharmacologic treatments. For more information on risk factors for \\nchildren with COVID-19, see Special Considerations in Children.\\nRecommendations\\nIn the absence of sufficient clinical trial data on the treatment of children with COVID-19, the Panel’s \\nrecommendations for the therapeutic management of nonhospitalized children are based largely on \\nsafety and efficacy data from clinical trials in adults (see Table 3a). No pediatric comparative studies \\nhave been published; therefore, all the quality of evidence ratings for the Panel’s recommendations in \\nthis section are based on expert opinion (i.e., a III rating).\\nThe majority of children with mild to moderate COVID-19 will not progress to more severe illness; \\ntherefore, the Panel recommends managing these patients with supportive care alone (AIII).

Imprecise definitions of comorbid conditions, insufficient granularity for differentiating \\nthe severity of comorbidities (e.g., mild vs. severe lung disease, poorly controlled vs. well-controlled \\ndiabetes), and small sample sizes limit the conclusions that can be drawn from individual studies and \\nmake comparing findings across studies difficult. \\nFurthermore, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection detected during admission screening of children who \\nare hospitalized for reasons other than COVID-19 may affect the estimated risk of severe COVID-19, \\nparticularly for patient groups that may have protocolized admissions (e.g., children with febrile \\nneutropenia, infants aged <90 days with fever). In addition, the published studies that have evaluated \\nthese associations in children are limited largely to case series without control groups and observational \\nstudies with methodologic limitations. \\nDespite these challenges, a risk-stratification framework needs to be developed that will allow clinicians \\nto identify the patients who are most likely to benefit from receiving treatment. These patients can \\nbe prioritized in situations where supply or logistical constraints make it impossible to offer therapy \\nto all eligible patients. Both the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the American Academy \\nof Pediatrics advocate for a risk-stratified approach to identifying the patients who are at the highest \\nrisk of progression to severe COVID-19 among those eligible for therapies under Food and Drug \\nAdministration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs).11,12 \\nThe Panel’s approach to risk stratification and prioritization considers COVID-19 vaccination \\nstatus, immune function, clinical risk factors, the strength of the evidence that demonstrates an \\nassociation between each clinical risk factor and severe disease, and expert opinion.7-10,13-27 See \\nSpecial Considerations in Children for more information on clinical risk factors. The Panel suggests \\nthat decisions regarding treatment be individualized, particularly for patients in the intermediate risk \\ncategory. Clinicians should consider the type, number, and severity of comorbid conditions, the child’s \\nvaccination status, and the time since vaccination. \\nComorbid conditions associated with severe COVID-19 are separated into the following categories in \\nTable 3b:\\n• Strong or Consistent Association With Progression to Severe COVID-19: Comorbid conditions for \\nwhich the published literature most consistently supports an increased risk of severe COVID-19. \\nPatients in this category are moderately or severely immunocompromised, at risk of severe \\nCOVID-19, and not expected to develop an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. \\n• Moderate or Inconsistent Association With Progression to Severe COVID-19: Comorbid \\nconditions and ages for which the published literature supports an association with severe \\nCOVID-19, but the association may be moderate or inconsistent across studies.

Therefore, the potential benefit from antiviral treatment is less clear for these patients. \\nPatients who are not up to date may have a lower level of protection against severe disease than patients \\nwho are up to date, but the data comparing these groups are limited. Evidence suggests that vaccine \\nprotection against severe COVID-19 wanes over time, particularly protection against the Omicron \\nvariant and its subvariants.29-32 Several studies suggested that people who have had SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection and were vaccinated have more durable protection than those who have had only an infection \\nor only been vaccinated.33,34 Clinicians should consider the time since a child’s vaccination when making \\ntreatment decisions.\\nHealth Disparities\\nCOVID-19–related outcomes are worse among medically underserved populations, although this factor \\nis not strictly a comorbid condition. Some racial and ethnic minority groups experience disproportionate \\nrates of COVID-19 hospitalization and are less likely to receive specific therapies.23,35-37 These factors \\nmay be relevant when making clinical decisions about treatment.38,39 See Special Considerations in \\nChildren for more information.\\nRationale for the Panel’s Recommendations \\nRitonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid)\\nRitonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir has received an FDA EUA for the treatment of mild to moderate \\nCOVID-19 in nonhospitalized adolescents aged ≥12 years and weighing ≥40 kg who are at high risk of \\nprogression to severe COVID-19.40 \\nThe EPIC-HR trial enrolled adults aged ≥18 years who were at high risk of severe COVID-19.41 \\nThey were randomized to receive ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir or placebo. The primary outcome of \\nCOVID-19–related hospitalization or all-cause mortality occurred in 8 of 1,039 patients (0.8%) who \\nreceived ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and in 66 of 1,046 patients (6.3%) who received placebo, an 89% \\nrelative risk reduction. No pediatric patients were included in the trial, and no pediatric safety data were \\nmade available. \\nRitonavir has been used extensively in pediatric patients as a pharmacokinetic booster for the treatment \\nof HIV and hepatitis C virus infection, and it has a known and tolerable side effect profile. In the FDA \\nEUA, the dose of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir authorized for adolescents aged ≥12 years and weighing \\n≥40 kg is expected to result in a drug exposure similar to that observed in adults.40 \\nGiven the high efficacy of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir in adults, its overall manageable side effect \\nprofile, the pediatric clinical experience with ritonavir, and the convenience of an oral medication, \\nthe Panel recommends the use of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) for nonhospitalized \\nadolescents aged ≥12 years and weighing ≥40 kg who have mild to moderate COVID-19 and are at the \\nhighest risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (BIII). Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is expected to be \\nactive against circulating variants, although clinical efficacy data are currently limited in children.42-44\\nBecause of the potential for significant drug-drug interactions with some concomitant medications, \\nritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir may not be the safest choice for some patients.

Throughout this section, the term “COVID-19” refers to the acute, primarily respiratory \\nillness due to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) \\nrefers to the postinfectious inflammatory condition. \\nTreatment Considerations for Children With COVID-19\\nTo date, no comparative clinical trials evaluating the treatment of COVID-19 in children have been \\npublished. Evaluations of pharmacologic therapies in children with COVID-19 have been limited to \\nsmall pharmacokinetic studies and retrospective observational reports.1-5 Therefore, more high-quality \\nrandomized trials, observational studies, and pharmacokinetic studies are urgently needed. Whenever \\npossible, clinical trials of therapeutics and multicenter observational cohorts should enroll children with \\nCOVID-19. \\nPublished guidance on the treatment of COVID-19 in children has been extrapolated mostly from \\nrecommendations for adults with COVID-19, recommendations for children with other viral infections, \\nand expert opinion.6-8 Applying adult data from COVID-19 trials to children is a unique challenge \\nbecause most children experience a mild course of illness with COVID-19.3 Relative to adults, children \\nwith COVID-19 have substantially lower mortality and less need for hospitalization.9-11 Because of these \\ndifferences in epidemiology and disease severity, the effect sizes of treatments for children are likely \\nto be smaller than those observed in adults. Therefore, to produce a beneficial outcome in children, the \\nnumber needed to treat is higher. Collectively, these factors influence the risk versus benefit balance for \\npharmacologic therapies in children. \\nOther challenges are the uncertainty about which comorbid conditions place children at the highest \\nrisk of severe COVID-19 and the uncertainty about the absolute magnitude of the increased risk from \\nthose comorbid conditions. For children with COVID-19, the type, number, and severity of comorbid \\nconditions influence decisions about pharmacologic treatment. For more information on risk factors \\nin children with COVID-19, see Special Considerations in Children and Therapeutic Management of \\nNonhospitalized Children With COVID-19.\\nRecommendations\\nIn the absence of sufficient clinical trial data on the treatment of children with COVID-19, the Panel’s \\nrecommendations for the therapeutic management of hospitalized children are based largely on safety \\nand efficacy data from clinical trials in adults, the child’s risk of disease progression, and expert \\nopinion (see Table 3c). For the Panel’s recommendations for adults, see Therapeutic Management of \\nHospitalized Adults With COVID-19.\\nIn general, data from clinical trials in adults are most applicable to the treatment of older children \\nwith severe COVID-19 and predominantly lower respiratory tract disease. Using data from clinical \\ntrials in adults to develop recommendations for children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have \\nclinical syndromes associated with other respiratory viruses (e.g., bronchiolitis, croup, asthma) is a \\nchallenge.

See Remdesivir and Special \\nConsiderations in People Who Are Immunocompromised for more information.\\nIn a trial conducted mostly among hospitalized adults with COVID-19 who did not receive supplemental \\noxygen at enrollment, a 5-day course of remdesivir was associated with greater clinical improvement \\nwhen compared with the standard of care.17 Remdesivir was also studied in ACTT-1, a double-blind, \\nplacebo-controlled, randomized trial for hospitalized adults with COVID-19 who received remdesivir \\nfor 10 days (or until hospital discharge) or placebo.18 The study reported that the remdesivir arm had \\na shorter time to clinical recovery than the placebo arm (10 days vs. 15 days; P < 0.001). A subgroup \\nanalysis demonstrated that patients who received conventional oxygen therapy had the greatest benefit. \\nNo benefit was detected for patients who did not receive supplemental oxygen or for those who received \\nnoninvasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation. No statistically significant differences in \\nmortality or in the need for new mechanical ventilation were detected, and the benefit of remdesivir in \\nthis study was limited to patients with symptoms for <10 days. \\nThree open-label trials in adults compared remdesivir to a local standard of care. The World Health \\nOrganization’s Solidarity trial enrolled hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 in 35 countries.19 In \\nthe overall cohort, no difference in hospital mortality was demonstrated (14.5% in the remdesivir arm \\nvs. 15.6% in the usual care arm; rate ratio 0.91; 95% CI, 0.82–1.02; P = 0.12). However, in the large \\nsubset of patients receiving supplemental oxygen but not NIV or mechanical ventilation, remdesivir \\nsignificantly reduced the risk of in-hospital mortality by 13% (14.6% vs. 16.3%; rate ratio 0.87; 95% CI, \\n0.76–0.99; P = 0.03). \\nThe CATCO study demonstrated similar findings.20 Treatment with remdesivir, when compared with \\nstandard care, reduced the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 \\n(8% vs. 15%; relative risk 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38–0.75). In this study, 87% of adult patients in both the \\nremdesivir arm and standard of care arm received dexamethasone. In contrast to these 2 studies, the \\nDisCoVeRy trial demonstrated no difference for any clinical outcome when the use of remdesivir plus \\nusual care was compared to usual care alone.21 \\nThe efficacy of remdesivir has not been evaluated in clinical trials of hospitalized children with \\nCOVID-19. A Phase 2/3, single-arm, open-label study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and \\npharmacokinetics of remdesivir in 53 hospitalized children with COVID-19.22 Children weighing 3 to \\n<40 kg received remdesivir 5 mg/kg on Day 1, followed by remdesivir 2.5 mg/kg daily.

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 28 days, which occurred in 22.9% of \\npatients randomized to receive dexamethasone versus 25.7% of patients randomized to receive usual \\ncare (age-adjusted rate ratio 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75–0.93; P < 0.001). Patients who required mechanical \\nventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) had the greatest effect size (29.3% vs. \\n41.4%; rate ratio 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51–0.81). No difference in outcomes was observed in patients who did \\nnot require supplemental oxygen (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio 1.19; 95% CI, 0.92–1.55). For the 28-day \\nmortality outcome, a difference between arms was observed in patients who required supplemental \\noxygen (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.94). However, it should be noted that these \\npatients were a heterogeneous group, including those who received either conventional oxygen or NIV . \\nSee Systemic Corticosteroids for detailed information. \\nThe safety and efficacy of using dexamethasone or other corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 \\nhave not been evaluated in pediatric patients. Given that the mortality for adults in the placebo arm in \\nthe RECOVERY trial was substantially greater than the mortality generally reported for children with \\nCOVID-19, caution is warranted when extrapolating from recommendations for adults and applying \\nthem to patients aged <18 years. \\nHowever, because of the effect size observed in the RECOVERY trial, the Panel recommends the use \\nof dexamethasone for children who require mechanical ventilation or ECMO (AIII). The Panel also \\nrecommends the use of dexamethasone, with or without concurrent remdesivir, for children who \\nrequire oxygen through a high-flow device or NIV (BIII). The Panel does not recommend routine \\nuse of corticosteroids for children who require only conventional oxygen, but corticosteroids can be \\nconsidered in combination with remdesivir for patients with increasing oxygen needs, particularly \\nadolescents (BIII). \\nEvidence has demonstrated that the use of corticosteroids does not benefit infants with viral bronchiolitis \\nnot related to COVID-19, and current American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommend against \\nthe use of corticosteroids in this population.28 There are no data specific to COVID-19 that support \\nthe use of corticosteroids in children with bronchiolitis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Patients treated with baricitinib showed a reduction in mortality when compared \\nwith those who received standard care.30 The reduction was greatest in patients who received \\nhigh-flow oxygen or NIV . Similarly, the ACTT-2 trial in adults showed that patients who received \\nbaricitinib plus remdesivir had improved time to recovery when compared with patients who received \\nremdesivir alone.31 This effect was most pronounced in patients who received high-flow oxygen or \\nNIV . In the ACTT-4 trial, 1,010 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive baricitinib plus remdesivir or \\ndexamethasone plus remdesivir.32 The study reported no difference between the arms for the outcome of \\nmechanical ventilation–free survival. \\nIn the RECOVERY trial, 8,156 patients, including 33 children aged 2 to 17 years, were randomized \\nto receive baricitinib or usual care (95% received corticosteroids).33 Treatment with baricitinib was \\nassociated with a 13% proportional reduction in mortality, with the greatest effect size occurring in \\npatients who received NIV . The RECOVERY investigators included these patients in a meta-analysis \\nand found that treatment with baricitinib was associated with a 20% relative reduction in mortality (rate \\nratio 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72–0.89; P < 0.0001). See Janus Kinase Inhibitors and Therapeutic Management \\nof Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for additional information. These data in adults indicate that \\nbaricitinib is likely to be most beneficial for patients receiving noninvasive forms of respiratory support. \\nSeveral open-label trials and cohort studies have evaluated baricitinib in children with autoinflammatory \\nand rheumatic diseases, including many children aged <5 years, and found the treatment was well \\ntolerated; however, the pharmacokinetics of baricitinib in younger children are not well studied.34-37 \\nInformation on the safety and effectiveness of the use of baricitinib in children with COVID-19 is \\nlimited to case reports. \\nIn contrast to the strong recommendation for its use in adults, baricitinib is not considered the standard \\nof care for all children who require high-flow oxygen or NIV because of the low mortality in children \\nwith COVID-19 (especially young children) and the limited data on the use of baricitinib in these \\nchildren.\\nExtrapolating from clinical trials among adults with COVID-19, the Panel recommends that: \\n• For children who require oxygen through a high-flow device or NIV and do not have rapid (e.g., \\nwithin 24 hours) improvement in oxygenation after initiation of dexamethasone, baricitinib can \\nbe considered for children aged 12 to 17 years (BIII) and for children aged 2 to 11 years (CIII). \\n• For children who require mechanical ventilation or ECMO and do not have rapid (e.g., within \\n24 hours) improvement in oxygenation after initiation of dexamethasone, baricitinib may be \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Tofacitinib has been studied \\nless extensively than baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19. Thus, tofacitinib, as an alternative to \\nbaricitinib, is recommended to be used in combination with dexamethasone in adults with COVID-19 \\nwho require high-flow oxygen or NIV . See Janus Kinase Inhibitors and Therapeutic Management of \\nHospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for additional information. \\nNo trials have evaluated the safety of using tofacitinib in children with COVID-19. Overall, there has \\nbeen more clinical experience with the use of tofacitinib than baricitinib in children, particularly when \\nused in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) as young as 2 years of age. A Phase 1 study \\nwas conducted to define the pharmacokinetics and safety of using tofacitinib in children,39 and a Phase \\n3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy of using tofacitinib in \\nchildren with JIA.40 Tofacitinib is available as a liquid formulation for children. \\nGiven the established safety of tofacitinib in the pediatric population, tofacitinib can be considered an \\nalternative for children hospitalized for COVID-19 if baricitinib is not available (BIII). The dose of \\ntofacitinib that should be used to treat hospitalized children with COVID-19 has not been established. \\nAs with baricitinib, the dose of tofacitinib for hospitalized children with COVID-19 likely needs to be \\nhigher than the dose typically used to treat pediatric rheumatologic diseases. Therefore, clinicians should \\nconsult with specialists experienced in treating children with immunosuppression (e.g., in pediatric \\ninfectious disease, pediatric rheumatology) when considering administering tofacitinib to hospitalized \\nchildren with COVID-19. \\nTocilizumab\\nTocilizumab is an interleukin-6 inhibitor that has received an FDA Emergency Use Authorization for \\nthe treatment of hospitalized adults and children with COVID-19 who are aged ≥2 years; receiving \\nsystemic corticosteroids; and require supplemental oxygen, NIV , mechanical ventilation, or ECMO.41 \\nTwo large randomized controlled trials (REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY) conducted among hospitalized \\nadults with COVID-19 have demonstrated reductions in mortality with the use of tocilizumab.42,43 See \\nInterleukin-6 Inhibitors and Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for \\nadditional information. \\nThe RECOVERY trial was an open-label study that included hospitalized adults who had an oxygen \\nsaturation of <92% on room air or were receiving supplemental oxygen therapy; patients also had \\nC-reactive protein levels ≥75 mg/L.43 Patients were randomized to receive tocilizumab plus usual care \\nor usual care alone. Mortality at 28 days was significantly lower in the tocilizumab arm compared to \\nthe usual care arm. The REMAP-CAP trial included adults with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 \\nwho were admitted to an intensive care unit and received either respiratory (i.e., NIV or mechanical \\nventilation) or cardiovascular organ (i.e., vasopressor/inotrope) support.42 Patients were randomized \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The median number of organ support-free days was higher for \\nthose who received tocilizumab than for those who received standard care, and in-hospital mortality \\nwas lower in the combined tocilizumab or sarilumab arm than in the standard care arm. In both \\nstudies, the majority of patients received dexamethasone (82% in the RECOVERY trial and 93% in the \\nREMAP-CAP trial). \\nStudies have evaluated the use of tocilizumab for the treatment of non–COVID-19 conditions in \\nchildren, including JIA44-48 and cytokine release syndrome related to chimeric antigen receptor T cell \\ntherapy.49 The FDA approved tocilizumab for use in children aged ≥2 years for these indications.44-48 The \\nuse of tocilizumab in children with severe cases of COVID-19 has been described only in case series.50-52\\nExtrapolating from clinical trials among adults with COVID-19, the Panel recommends that:\\n• For children who require oxygen through a high-flow device or NIV and do not have rapid (e.g., \\nwithin 24 hours) improvement in oxygenation after initiation of dexamethasone, tocilizumab can \\nbe considered for children aged 12 to 17 years (BIII) and for children aged 2 to 11 years (CIII). \\n• For children who require mechanical ventilation or ECMO and do not have rapid (e.g., within 24 \\nhours) improvement in oxygenation after initiation of dexamethasone, if tocilizumab has not been \\nstarted, addition of tocilizumab may be considered for children aged 12 to 17 years (BIII) and for \\nchildren aged 2 to 11 years (CIII). \\nData from REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY are most likely to be applicable to high-risk adolescent \\npatients. Clinicians should consult with specialists experienced in treating children with \\nimmunosuppression (e.g., in pediatric infectious disease, pediatric rheumatology) when considering the \\nuse of tocilizumab in younger children with COVID-19. \\nSarilumab \\nSarilumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-6 receptors, is not authorized by the FDA \\nfor the treatment of COVID-19. Data on the efficacy of sarilumab for the treatment of COVID-19 \\nhyperinflammation are limited, and there is a lack of pediatric dosing information. Therefore, the Panel \\nrecommends against the use of sarilumab in hospitalized children with COVID-19, except in a clinical \\ntrial (AIII).\\nAnticoagulation in Children With COVID-19\\nRecommendations\\n• The Panel recommends prophylactic anticoagulation for children aged ≥12 years who are \\nhospitalized for COVID-19, unless there are contraindications (BIII). \\n• Weighing the risk factors for thrombosis and bleeding, some Panel members would use \\nprophylactic anticoagulation for children aged <12 years who are hospitalized for COVID-19. \\nInstitutional standards for anticoagulation should be followed. \\n• There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of \\ntherapeutic anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in children of any age with \\nCOVID-19.\\nLimited data characterize the risk of thromboembolic disease in children with COVID-19. \\nAmong children who do not have COVID-19, most thromboembolic events occur in neonates and \\nadolescents.53,54 In a multicenter, retrospective cohort study that included 814 pediatric patients with \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The multidisciplinary team may include experts in cardiology, \\nhematology, infectious disease, intensive care, and rheumatology. MIS-C is defined by multiorgan \\ndysfunction, and input from other pediatric subspecialists may be needed depending on the presentation \\nof the individual patient. Thus, children with MIS-C should be cared for at centers with access to these \\npediatric specialists.\\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoids are the most commonly used \\nimmunomodulatory medications in reported cohorts of children with MIS-C.6-14 The American College \\nof Rheumatology has outlined initial diagnostic and treatment considerations for patients with MIS-C \\nand recommends using IVIG in combination with glucocorticoids as first-tier therapy for most \\nhospitalized children with MIS-C.15 Several nonrandomized studies suggest that the use of IVIG plus \\nglucocorticoids is associated with less treatment failure, faster recovery of cardiac function, shorter \\nintensive care unit (ICU) stays, and less need for treatment escalation than IVIG monotherapy.7,16-22 \\nBased on these data, the Panel recommends using IVIG in combination with low to moderate doses of \\nglucocorticoids for children hospitalized with MIS-C (AIIb). \\nIVIG should be administered at a dose of 2 g/kg of ideal body weight, with a maximum total dose of 100 \\ng. The patient’s cardiac function and fluid status should be monitored carefully during the IVIG infusion. \\nIVIG can be given in divided doses of 1 g/kg of ideal body weight over 2 days if there is a concern \\nabout the patient’s fluid status. Methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day, or another glucocorticoid at an \\nequivalent dose, is considered low to moderate glucocorticoid dosing. When the patient has improved \\nclinically (e.g., when the patient is afebrile, end-organ dysfunction resolves, and inflammatory markers \\ntrend downward), a steroid taper should be initiated. Typically, the patient’s clinical status guides the \\ntaper, and it continues for several weeks to avoid rebound inflammation.\\nGlucocorticoid monotherapy is an alternative initial treatment for MIS-C. Some studies have shown \\nthat patients treated with this approach had similar outcomes to patients treated with IVIG monotherapy \\nor IVIG plus glucocorticoids.18,20,23,24 However, secondary analyses indicate that patients who were \\ninitially treated with IVIG plus glucocorticoids had faster time to improvement, less need for treatment \\nescalation, and faster time to defervescence than patients who received glucocorticoid monotherapy.20 \\nThus, the combination of IVIG and glucocorticoids appears to provide additional benefits that are not \\nprovided by glucocorticoid monotherapy. \\nInitial treatment that includes IVIG is also beneficial because it reduces the frequency of coronary \\nartery aneurysms (CAAs) in patients with Kawasaki disease.14,25 Kawasaki disease is increasingly \\ndifficult to differentiate from MIS-C, and more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants have resulted in MIS-C \\npresentations that are similar to Kawasaki disease.26 Distinguishing MIS-C from Kawasaki disease is \\nfurther complicated by the fact that seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 is now widespread, which makes \\nestablishing the epidemiological link required for the MIS-C diagnosis difficult. For these reasons, \\nthe Panel recommends using IVIG plus glucocorticoids as the initial therapy for patients with MIS-C \\n(AIIb). Glucocorticoid monotherapy is recommended only if IVIG is unavailable or contraindicated \\n(BIIa). IVIG monotherapy is recommended only if glucocorticoids are contraindicated (BIIb).\\nClinical Data on Initial Immunomodulatory Therapy for MIS-C\\nIntravenous Immunoglobulin in Combination With Glucocorticoids\\nNo randomized clinical trials evaluating the use of IVIG plus glucocorticoids for the treatment of MIS-C \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The comparative benefit of adding steroids to IVIG for MIS-C treatment has been \\nestimated in observational cohort studies that used statistical techniques to adjust for confounders. The \\nfirst of these studies employed observational data from a national surveillance system cohort in France \\nand used propensity matching to compare short-term outcomes in children with MIS-C who were treated \\ninitially with IVIG 2 gm/kg alone or IVIG plus methylprednisolone (most patients received 1.6–2 mg/\\nkg/day for 5 days).16 The study team observed a lower risk of treatment failure (defined as a fever that \\npersisted for 2 days after treatment or recurrent fever within 7 days), less need for hemodynamic support, \\nless severe left ventricular dysfunction, and shorter ICU stays among the children who were initially \\ntreated with the combination therapy. This was a small study, and only 32 patients treated with IVIG plus \\nmethylprednisolone and 64 patients treated with IVIG alone could be matched based on propensity score.\\nA larger study in the United States analyzed data from the Overcoming COVID-19 surveillance registry \\nto evaluate immunomodulatory therapy for MIS-C.17 The study included 103 patients who received initial \\ntreatment with IVIG plus glucocorticoids and an equal number of propensity score–matched patients \\nwho received IVIG alone. The risk of cardiovascular dysfunction on or after Day 2 was measured among \\nthese patients using a composite outcome of left ventricular ejection fraction of <55% or vasopressor use. \\nThe composite outcome occurred in 17% of patients in the IVIG plus glucocorticoids arm and in 31% \\nof patients in the IVIG alone arm (risk ratio 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34–0.94). In addition, patients treated with \\nthe combination of IVIG and glucocorticoids were less likely to require adjunctive immunomodulatory \\ntherapy than those treated with IVIG alone. Methylprednisolone, the glucocorticoid that was prescribed \\nmost often, was administered to 353 patients (68% of patients, including nonpropensity score–matched \\npatients, in the entire cohort). Among these patients, the dosing of methylprednisolone ranged from 2 mg/\\nkg/day in 284 patients (80%) to 10 to 30 mg/kg/day in 69 patients (20%). \\nA third study, the international, observational BATS study, compared patients with MIS-C who received \\nIVIG alone (n = 246) with those who received IVIG plus glucocorticoids (n = 208).18 This study found \\nsimilar rates for the composite outcome of inotropic support or mechanical ventilation by Day 2 or later \\nor death in both treatment arms. The composite outcome occurred in 44 of 221 patients (21%) in the \\nIVIG alone arm and in 56 of 180 patients (31%) in the IVIG plus glucocorticoids arm (OR 0.77; 95% CI, \\n0.33–1.82). However, escalation of immunomodulatory treatment was less common among the patients \\nwho received IVIG plus glucocorticoids than among those who received IVIG alone (OR 0.18; 95% CI, \\n0.10–0.33). Notably, the study allowed for the inclusion of patients who had any inflammatory illness \\nafter acute COVID-19 but who did not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or World \\nHealth Organization (WHO) criteria for MIS-C. This multicenter study included sites from 34 countries, \\nwhich introduced the potential for more variability in supportive care. In addition, the overall percentage \\nof patients with abnormal cardiac findings (12% of the 538 patients) was lower than in other cohorts. \\nIntravenous Immunoglobulin Monotherapy\\nThe use of IVIG is long established for patients with Kawasaki disease, a syndrome that has overlapping \\nmanifestations with MIS-C. Thus, the product’s safety profile is well understood. In patients with \\nKawasaki disease, IVIG reduces the development of CAAs,25,27 a complication also observed in some \\npatients with MIS-C. IVIG is the most frequently used therapy for MIS-C. In a national survey of U.S. \\ninstitutional protocols for managing MIS-C, IVIG was the first-line therapy in 98% of 40 participating \\ncenters.28 \\nData on the efficacy of IVIG in patients with MIS-C is extrapolated from case series that show mostly \\nfavorable outcomes. In a series of 539 MIS-C cases, 77% of the children received IVIG.14 A sizeable \\nproportion of these children had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at admission (172 of 503 \\nevaluable patients [34.2%]).

In addition, there is \\naccumulating evidence that glucocorticoids administered in combination with IVIG are more effective \\nas treatment for MIS-C. However, IVIG monotherapy may be a reasonable treatment option for a small \\nsubset of patients with MIS-C who are stable (i.e., not in shock or with organ-threatening disease) and \\nhave contraindications for glucocorticoid therapy. Such contraindications may include concern about the \\nimpact of corticosteroids on the diagnostic evaluation or an underlying medical condition.\\nGlucocorticoid Monotherapy\\nThe observational BATS study also compared initial IVIG monotherapy treatment (n =  246)  with \\nglucocorticoid treatment (n = 99) and found no differences in primary or secondary outcomes between \\nthese 2 cohorts.18 However, in a subgroup analysis of patients who met the WHO criteria for MIS-C, the \\nglucocorticoid arm (n = 78) had significantly fewer patients who required respiratory support by Day 2 \\nor later or died than the IVIG arm (n = 192). \\nIn a subsequent publication, the BATS consortium reported on additional patients with MIS-C who were \\nenrolled in the study (over 2,000 patients in total).20 The study had 2 primary outcomes. The first was \\na composite of the need for inotropic or ventilator support on or after Day 2 or death. The second was \\ntime to improvement by 1 level on an ordinal severity scale. In this larger study, there was once again \\nno difference in the primary outcomes among the arms in a propensity-weighted analysis (combination \\ntherapy with IVIG plus glucocorticoids was compared to IVIG alone, and glucocorticoid monotherapy \\nwas compared to IVIG alone). \\nIn secondary analyses, patients who received combination therapy had a lower rate of treatment \\nescalation than those who received IVIG alone, and patients who received glucocorticoid monotherapy \\nhad a lower rate of treatment escalation than those who received IVIG alone.20 The combination therapy \\narm had a faster time to improvement, less need for treatment escalation, and a lower rate of persistent \\nfever on Day 2 than the glucocorticoid monotherapy arm. These treatment arms had similar frequencies \\nof CAAs measured at hospital discharge and similar CAA severity. Among the 236 patients with \\ndocumented CAAs during the initial hospitalization, 196 patients had follow-up echocardiograms. More \\nthan 90% of the CAAs resolved, with similar rates of resolution across the treatment groups.\\nAs reported in the initial publication for the observational BATS study, the inclusion criteria were broad, \\nand the patients did not need to meet the full WHO case definition for MIS-C.20 Compared to the other \\ntreatment arms, the IVIG plus glucocorticoid arm had a greater proportion of patients that met the WHO \\ncase definition for MIS-C, were ventilated and/or treated with inotropes at Day 0, and had CAAs (even \\nbefore the initiation of immunomodulators). Many patients received additional immunomodulatory \\nagents after Day 1, including 230 of 487 patients in the initial glucocorticoids alone group who also \\nreceived IVIG. Finally, COVID-19 vaccination has been associated with reduced incidence and severity \\nof MIS-C,29-31 but vaccination was not evaluated in the study.\\nTo date, the only randomized trial that evaluated treatments in patients with MIS-C was conducted \\nin Switzerland.23 This open-label, multicenter study compared methylprednisolone 10 mg/kg per day \\nfor 3 days (n = 37) to a single dose of IVIG 2 gm/kg (n = 38). In this study, patients met the criteria \\nfor the case definition of pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome—temporally associated with \\nSARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). There was no difference between the arms for the primary outcome of length \\nof hospital stay or death. The length of hospital stay from admission to discharge was 6 days for both \\narms (estimated effect size -0.037 of the log10 transformed times; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.065; P = 0.42).

The small sample size in this study \\nlimited the power for treatment comparisons, and many patients received additional therapies for MIS-C \\nafter randomization. \\nIntensification Immunomodulatory Therapy for MIS-C\\nChildren with MIS-C typically respond briskly to immunomodulatory therapy and show clinical \\nimprovements within the first 24 hours of treatment. Treatment response is characterized by \\nresolution of fever, improvement of organ function, and reduction of levels of inflammatory markers, \\nparticularly C-reactive protein. In contrast, refractory disease is often accompanied by persistent fever, \\nworsening organ dysfunction, and increasing levels of inflammatory markers. Intensification therapy \\nis recommended for children with refractory MIS-C who do not improve within 24 hours of receiving \\ninitial immunomodulatory therapy (AIII). Children with uncontrolled MIS-C despite treatment with \\nIVIG and low to moderate doses of glucocorticoids will often continue to deteriorate, and this decline in \\nclinical status can be quite rapid. \\nNo studies have compared the different intensification therapies used for patients with MIS-C. The \\ndata on this topic are limited to results from cohort studies in patients with MIS-C, opinions from \\nexperts, and clinician experiences treating children with other hyperinflammatory syndromes, such \\nas Kawasaki disease and macrophage activation syndrome. For children with refractory MIS-C, the \\nPanel recommends providing additional immunomodulatory therapy (listed in alphabetical order) with \\nhigh-dose anakinra (BIIb), higher-dose glucocorticoids (BIIb), or infliximab (BIIb). Currently, \\nthere is insufficient evidence to determine which of these agents is most effective for intensification \\ntherapy in patients with refractory MIS-C. In certain patients with severe illness, intensification therapy \\nmay include dual therapy with higher-dose glucocorticoids plus anakinra (BIII) or higher-dose \\nglucocorticoids plus infliximab (BIII). Anakinra and infliximab should not be used in combination. \\nA second dose of IVIG is not commonly reported in the literature as a strategy for intensification therapy \\nin patients with MIS-C. This may be due to the high rates of IVIG resistance, the rapid pace of disease \\nescalation, and the risk for fluid overload in patients with MIS-C.10 Therefore, the Panel recommends \\nagainst a second dose of IVIG for intensification therapy in patients with refractory MIS-C (BIII). \\nPatients with MIS-C who receive multiple immunomodulatory agents are at risk for infection and need \\nto be monitored carefully. Most children with MIS-C were previously healthy. In patients who have an \\nimmune disorder or are taking immunosuppression therapy, the risk of infection is greater. The risks and \\nbenefits of using immunomodulatory agents in patients with MIS-C who are immunocompromised need \\nto be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\\nClinical Data on Intensification Immunomodulatory Therapy for MIS-C\\nHigh-Dose Glucocorticoids\\nThe use of high-dose glucocorticoids in pediatric patients with other inflammatory conditions, \\nsuch as Kawasaki disease and macrophage activation syndrome, is well established.32,33 High-dose \\nglucocorticoid therapy is defined as intravenous (IV) administration of 10 to 30 mg/kg/day of \\nmethylprednisolone (or an equivalent corticosteroid). Often, this higher dose of glucocorticoids is \\nadministered for 1 to 3 days before returning to low to moderate doses (1–2 mg/kg/day). Multiple \\nobservational studies have evaluated the use of high-dose glucocorticoids in children with MIS-C.17,34 \\nIn addition, single-center treatment protocols for MIS-C that incorporate high-dose glucocorticoids into \\nthe treatment algorithm have been published.19 Implementation of the protocols has resulted in positive \\nclinical outcomes in patients with MIS-C. \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Anakinra has a short half-life (4–6 hours), and the medication can be stopped quickly, \\nwhich many providers regard as a benefit relative to longer-acting immunomodulators. The Panel’s \\nrecommendation for the use of high-dose anakinra (5–10 mg/kg/day) in patients with MIS-C is based \\non the demonstrated efficacy of high-dose anakinra in patients with macrophage activation syndrome. \\nThe duration of anakinra therapy varies in the literature. Some clinicians prescribe anakinra as a steroid-\\nsparing agent to manage MIS-C for longer periods (e.g., up to 2 weeks).\\nInfliximab\\nThe Panel recommends a single dose of infliximab 5 to 10 mg/kg IV as an option for intensification \\ntherapy. Infliximab has been studied for the treatment of MIS-C in a single-center retrospective study \\nthat compared patients treated with IVIG alone (n = 20) to those treated with IVIG and a single dose of \\ninfliximab 10 mg/kg IV (n = 52).43 Infliximab was used as the first-line therapy in this study, and the \\npatients were not treated with glucocorticoids. The patients who received IVIG and infliximab were \\nmore likely to be admitted to the ICU and had more severe illness than those who received IVIG alone. \\nHowever, the patients who received the combination therapy were less likely to require additional \\ntherapy after 24 hours (the primary outcome). In addition, patients who received IVIG and infliximab \\nhad shorter stays in the ICU and improved cardiac outcomes. These results suggest that infliximab has a \\ntherapeutic effect in patients with MIS-C. \\nInfliximab is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in children with inflammatory \\nbowel disease and is used widely to treat juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Infliximab has also been used to \\ntreat IVIG-resistant Kawasaki disease.44,45 Although the half-life of infliximab in patients with MIS-C is \\nunknown, it likely has effects that persist for several weeks. This extended period of drug activity may \\nprovide a steroid-sparing effect in patients with MIS-C. \\nAntithrombotic Therapy for MIS-C\\nThe Panel recommends the use of low-dose aspirin for patients with MIS-C who do not have risk \\nfactors for bleeding (AIII). This recommendation is largely derived from experience treating children \\nwith Kawasaki disease and the increased likelihood of analogous platelet activation and endothelial \\ndysfunction in children with MIS-C.46 Children treated with aspirin and steroids should also receive \\nprophylactic H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors. Patients with MIS-C who have large CAAs \\n(Z-score ≥10) should receive therapeutic anticoagulation according to the American Heart Association \\nguidelines for Kawasaki disease (AIII). Children with left ventricular dysfunction are at risk for \\nintracardiac thrombosis. Patients with MIS-C and moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction who \\nhave no risk factors for bleeding should receive therapeutic anticoagulation (AIII).\\nThere is less consensus on the use of either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with \\nMIS-C who do not have large CAAs or moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction. Children with \\nMIS-C have marked elevations in D-dimer levels and other abnormalities of coagulation, which suggests \\nthat they may be at increased risk for thrombosis.47 In a multicenter retrospective study of children with \\nacute COVID-19 and MIS-C, the independent risk factors for thrombosis included indwelling catheters, \\nolder age (>12 years), malignancy, admission to the ICU, and elevated D-dimer levels.48 In a multicenter, \\nPhase 2 trial of enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in children hospitalized for COVID-19 and MIS-C \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Clinicians also need to focus on preventing ICU-related \\ncomplications, as they would for any patient admitted to the ICU. \\nSelected Clinical Manifestations of COVID-19 Critical Illness\\nSevere Pulmonary Disease\\nMost patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 have severe pulmonary disease. Almost all of \\nthese patients meet the diagnostic criteria for ARDS. Patients with COVID-19 and severe pulmonary \\ninvolvement often manifest extrapulmonary disease and exhibit laboratory markers of acute \\ninflammation. Patients typically progress to critical illness 10 to 12 days after the onset of COVID-19 \\nsymptoms.\\nInflammatory Response\\nMany critically ill patients with COVID-19 meet the criteria for virus-induced sepsis because they have \\nlife-threatening organ dysfunction related to a dysregulated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.2 \\nPatients with COVID-19 may express increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-\\ninflammatory cytokines, a condition that has been called “cytokine release syndrome” or a “cytokine \\nstorm,” but these terms are imprecise and misnomers. The magnitude of cytokine elevation in many \\ncritically ill patients with COVID-19 is modest compared to the levels in patients with sepsis and ARDS \\nnot related to COVID-19.3,4 \\nThromboembolic Events\\nProthrombotic states and higher rates of venous thromboembolic disease have been observed in \\nadults who are critically ill with COVID-19. In some studies, thromboemboli were diagnosed in \\npatients who received prophylactic doses of heparin.5-7 Autopsy studies provide additional evidence of \\nthromboembolic disease and microvascular thrombosis in patients with COVID-19.8 See Antithrombotic \\nTherapy in Patients With COVID-19 for a more detailed discussion. \\nRenal and Hepatic Dysfunction\\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a pulmonary pathogen, renal and hepatic dysfunction are \\nconsistently described in adults with severe COVID-19.9,10 In a cohort of critically ill adults in Brazil, the \\ndevelopment of acute kidney injury that required renal replacement therapy was associated with a poor \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The patients also had signs \\nof cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and neurologic disease. This constellation of signs and \\nsymptoms has been designated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A). The Centers for \\nDisease Control and Prevention has developed a case definition for MIS-A. This syndrome is similar to \\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which has been well described. \\nA diagnosis of MIS-A may be made after other causes for the condition (e.g., bacterial sepsis) have \\nbeen excluded. Although there are currently no controlled clinical trial data from patients with MIS-A to \\nguide treatment of the syndrome, case reports have described the use of intravenous immunoglobulin, \\ncorticosteroids, or interleukin-1 inhibitor therapy.22-24 Some observational evidence supports the Panel’s \\nrecommendations for the therapeutic management of MIS-C, and those recommendations can be applied \\nto MIS-A in most circumstances. See Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Children With MIS-C, \\nPlus a Discussion on MIS-A for more information.\\nOther Complications Related to Intensive Care Units\\nWhen treating patients with COVID-19, clinicians need to minimize the risk of conventional ICU \\ncomplications. Patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 are at risk for nosocomial infections, such \\nas ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and catheter-related bloodstream \\ninfections, and for other complications of critical illness care. \\nAdditional Considerations\\nDrug-Drug Interactions\\nAll patients in the ICU should be routinely monitored for drug-drug interactions.

Assess, prevent, and manage pain \\nB. Both spontaneous awakening trials and breathing trials \\nC. Choice of analgesia and sedation \\nD. Delirium: assess, prevent, and manage \\nE. Early mobility and exercise \\nF. Family engagement and empowerment \\nThe A–F Liberation Bundle provides frontline staff with practical application strategies for each \\nelement, and an interprofessional team model should be used to incorporate the elements.29 This \\napproach helps standardize communication among team members, improves survival, and reduces \\nlong-term cognitive dysfunction of patients.30 The elements of the A–F Liberation Bundle represent the \\nsteps required to implement the SCCM Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management \\nof Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU.25\\nDespite the known benefits of the A–F Liberation Bundle,29 its impact has not been directly assessed in \\npatients with COVID-19. However, implementing the elements of the bundle should be encouraged to \\nimprove patient outcomes in the ICU. \\nSome factors may impede routine implementation of the A–F Liberation Bundle and increase the risk of \\nICU and post-ICU complications. For example, staff workload increases when patients with COVID-19 \\nrequire prolonged mechanical ventilation, deep sedation, or neuromuscular blockade. In addition, drug \\nshortages, which were common early in the pandemic, may affect the choice of analgesia or sedation. \\nDuring a drug shortage, older sedatives that have prolonged durations of action and active metabolites \\nare more likely to be prescribed.\\nPost-Intensive Care Syndrome\\nPost-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is a spectrum of physical, cognitive, and/or psychiatric disability \\nthat affects survivors of critical illness and persists after a patient leaves the ICU.31,32 Patients with PICS \\nmay present with varying levels of impairment, including profound muscle weakness (ICU-acquired \\nweakness); problems with thinking and judgment (cognitive dysfunction); and mental health problems, \\nsuch as problems sleeping, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. ICU-acquired \\nweakness affects 33% of all patients who receive mechanical ventilation, 50% of patients with sepsis, \\nand ≤50% of patients who remain in the ICU for ≥1 week.33-35 Cognitive dysfunction affects 30% to 80% \\nof patients discharged from the ICU.36-38 About 50% of ICU survivors do not return to work within 1 \\nyear after discharge.39 \\nAlthough no single risk factor has been associated with PICS, there are opportunities to minimize \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

PICS also \\naffects family members who participate in the care of their loved ones. One study reported that a third \\nof family members who had major decision-making roles experienced mental health problems, such as \\ndepression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.40 \\nSome patients with COVID-19 who have been treated in the ICU express manifestations of PICS.41 \\nAlthough specific therapies for PICS induced by COVID-19 are not yet available, health care providers \\nshould be aware that cognitive impairment or related problems may develop in patients who have had \\nsevere or critical COVID-19. \\nAdvance Care Planning and Goals of Care\\nThe advance care plans and the goals of care for all critically ill patients must be assessed at hospital \\nadmission and regularly thereafter. This is an essential element of care for all patients. Information \\non palliative care for patients with COVID-19 can be found at the National Coalition for Hospice and \\nPalliative Care website.\\nTo guide shared decision making in cases of serious illness, advance care planning should include \\nidentifying existing advance directives that outline a patient’s preferences and values. Values and care \\npreferences should be discussed, documented, and revisited regularly for patients with or without prior \\ndirectives. Specialty palliative care teams can facilitate communication between clinicians and surrogate \\ndecision makers, support frontline clinicians, and provide direct patient care services.\\nAt hospital admission, surrogate decision makers should be identified for all critically ill patients \\nwith COVID-19. Early in the pandemic, infection-control policies for COVID-19 often created \\ncommunication barriers for surrogate decision makers. At that time, most discussions between clinicians \\nand surrogate decision makers about treatment options occurred through telecommunication. However, \\nmany of those policies have been rescinded, and health care providers and surrogate decision makers \\nshould communicate in person when possible.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC), an initiative supported by SCCM and the European Society \\nof Intensive Care Medicine, issued the Guidelines on the Management of Critically Ill Adults with \\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in March 2020, and a revised version was published in March \\n2021.1 The Panel based its recommendations for the care of critically ill adults with COVID-19 on the \\nSSC COVID-19 guidelines with permission, and the Panel gratefully acknowledges the work of the SSC \\nCOVID-19 Guidelines panel.

Dopamine increases MAP and cardiac output, primarily \\ndue to increases in stroke volume and heart rate. Norepinephrine is more potent than dopamine and may \\nbe more effective at reversing hypotension in patients with septic shock. Dopamine may be particularly \\nuseful in patients with compromised systolic function, but it causes more tachycardia and may be more \\narrhythmogenic than norepinephrine.14 Dopamine may also influence the endocrine response via the \\nhypothalamic pituitary axis and have immunosuppressive effects.15 A systematic review and meta-\\nanalysis of 11 non–COVID-19 randomized controlled trials that compared vasopressors used to treat \\npatients with septic shock found that norepinephrine use resulted in lower all-cause mortality (risk ratio \\n0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98) and a lower risk of arrhythmias (risk ratio 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.58) than \\ndopamine use.16 Although the beta-1 activity of dopamine would be useful in patients with myocardial \\ndysfunction, the greater risk of arrhythmias limits its use.17,18\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The duration of hydrocortisone \\ntherapy is usually a clinical decision. \\n• Adult patients who are receiving corticosteroids for COVID-19 are receiving sufficient \\nreplacement therapy and do not require additional hydrocortisone. \\nReferences\\n1.

The most common symptom is dyspnea, which is often accompanied by hypoxemia. Patients \\nwith severe disease typically require supplemental oxygen and should be monitored closely for worsening \\nrespiratory status, because some patients may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\\nGoal of Oxygenation\\nThe optimal oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) in adults with COVID-19 who are \\nreceiving supplemental oxygen is unknown. However, a target SpO2 of 92% to 96% seems logical, \\nconsidering that indirect evidence from patients without COVID-19 suggests that an SpO2 <92% or \\n>96% may be harmful.1,2 Special care should be taken when assessing SpO2 in patients with darker skin \\npigmentation, as recent reports indicate that occult hypoxemia (defined as arterial oxygen saturation \\n[SaO2] <88% despite an SpO2 >92%) is more common in these patients.3,4 See Clinical Spectrum of \\nSARS-CoV-2 Infection for more information.\\nThe potential harm of maintaining an SpO2 <92% was demonstrated during a trial that randomly assigned \\npatients with ARDS who did not have COVID-19 to either a conservative oxygen strategy (target SpO2 of \\n88% to 92%) or a liberal oxygen strategy (target SpO2 ≥96%).1 The trial was stopped early due to futility \\nafter enrolling 205 patients, but increased mortality was observed at Day 90 in the conservative oxygen \\nstrategy arm (between-group risk difference 14%; 95% CI, 0.7% to 27%), and a trend toward increased \\nmortality was observed at Day 28 (between-group risk difference 8%; 95% CI, -5% to 21%).\\nThe results of a meta-analysis of 25 randomized trials that involved patients without COVID-19 \\ndemonstrated the potential harm of maintaining an SpO2 >96%.2 This study found that a liberal oxygen \\nsupplementation strategy (a median fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] of 0.52) was associated with an \\nincreased risk of in-hospital mortality (relative risk 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03–1.43) when compared with a \\nmore conservative SpO2 supplementation strategy (a median FiO2 of 0.21).\\nAcute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure\\nIn adults with COVID-19 and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, conventional oxygen therapy may be \\ninsufficient to meet the oxygen needs of the patient. Options for providing enhanced respiratory support \\ninclude using high-flow nasal canula (HFNC) oxygen, noninvasive ventilation (NIV), intubation and \\nmechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In this section, mechanical ventilation \\nrefers to the delivery of positive pressure ventilation through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube.

A randomized study of 711 patients with \\nCOVID-19 in 34 intensive care units (ICUs) in France compared HFNC oxygen delivery to oxygen \\ndelivery through a nonrebreather mask.5 The patients had acute respiratory failure with a ratio of arterial \\npartial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ≤200 mm Hg. The mean FiO2 was \\n0.58 in both arms. Although the difference between arms for the primary endpoint of 28-day mortality \\nwas not statistically significant (10% in the HFNC oxygen arm vs. 11% in the conventional oxygen arm; \\nabsolute difference -1.2%; 95% CI, -5.8% to 3.4%; P = 0.60), the intubation rate was significantly lower \\nin the HFNC oxygen arm than in the conventional oxygen arm. Unless a contraindication exists, most \\nPanel members would switch to HFNC oxygen delivery for patients with respiratory failure who do not \\nrequire mechanical ventilation but have worsening hypoxemia or increased work of breathing despite \\nreceiving conventional oxygen at flow rates up to 10 L/min. \\nFor patients with COVID-19 and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who do not respond to \\nconventional oxygen therapy, HFNC oxygen is preferred over NIV . No studies directly compare HFNC \\noxygen with mask-delivered NIV in patients with COVID-19; therefore, this guidance is based on an \\nunblinded clinical trial in patients without COVID-19 who had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.6 \\nStudy participants were randomized to receive HFNC oxygen, conventional oxygen therapy, or NIV . \\nThe patients in the HFNC oxygen arm had more ventilator-free days (mean 24 days) than those in the \\nconventional oxygen therapy arm (mean 22 days) or the NIV arm (mean 19 days; P = 0.02). In addition, \\nthe conventional oxygen therapy arm (HR 2.01; 95% CI, 1.01–3.99) and the NIV arm (HR 2.50; 95% \\nCI, 1.31–4.78) had higher 90-day mortality than the HFNC oxygen arm. In the subgroup of patients with \\nsevere hypoxemia (those with PaO2/FiO2 ≤200 mm Hg), the HFNC oxygen arm had a lower intubation \\nrate than the conventional oxygen therapy arm (HR 2.07) and the NIV arm (HR 2.57). \\nThe trial’s findings were corroborated by a meta-analysis of 8 trials with 1,084 participants that assessed \\nthe effectiveness of oxygenation strategies.7 Compared to NIV , HFNC oxygen reduced the rate of \\nintubation (OR 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31–0.73) and ICU mortality (OR 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20–0.63). \\nOne small study compared the use of NIV delivered by a helmet device to HFNC oxygen in patients \\nwith COVID-19. The HENIVOT trial randomized 109 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 \\n(defined as those who had PaO2/FiO2 ≤200 mm Hg) to receive either NIV via a helmet device or HFNC \\noxygen.8 The study found no difference between the arms for the primary outcome of respiratory \\nsupport–free days. However, only 30% of patients in the NIV arm required endotracheal intubation \\ncompared to 51% of patients in the HFNC oxygen arm (P = 0.03). \\nTwo larger studies compared the use of NIV with conventional oxygen therapy in patients with \\nCOVID-19. The RECOVERY-RS trial was an adaptive randomized controlled trial that was essentially \\nconducted as 2 separate trials that compared NIV and HFNC oxygen to the same conventional oxygen \\ntherapy control group.9 The trial was stopped early and enrolled fewer than a third of the planned sample \\nsize of 4,002 participants. Between April 2020 and May 2021, 1,273 adults with acute hypoxemic \\nrespiratory failure related to COVID-19 were randomized to receive NIV (n = 380), HFNC oxygen (n = \\n418), or conventional oxygen therapy (n = 475).

Although \\nprone positioning has been shown to improve oxygenation and outcomes in patients with moderate to \\nsevere ARDS who are receiving mechanical ventilation,15,16 there is less evidence regarding the benefit \\nof prone positioning in awake patients who require supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation. \\nSeveral case series of patients with COVID-19 who required oxygen or NIV have reported that awake \\nprone positioning improved oxygenation,17-20 and some series have also reported low intubation rates \\nafter awake prone positioning.19,20\\nThe Awake Prone Positioning Meta-Trial Group has conducted the largest trial on awake prone \\npositioning.21 This study was a prospective, multinational meta-trial of 6 open-label, randomized, \\ncontrolled, superiority trials that compared awake prone positioning to standard care in adults who \\nrequired HFNC oxygen for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. \\nThe study enrolled 1,126 patients between April 2, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and the intention-to-treat \\nanalysis included 1,121 patients.21 Of the 564 patients who underwent awake prone positioning, 223 \\n(40%) met the composite primary endpoint of intubation or death within 28 days of enrollment. Among \\nthe 557 patients who received standard care, 257 (46%) met the primary endpoint (relative risk 0.86; \\n95% CI, 0.75−0.98). The incidence of intubation by Day 28 was lower in the awake prone positioning \\narm than in the standard care arm (HR intubation 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62−0.91). There was no difference \\nin 28-day mortality between the awake prone positioning arm and the standard care arm (HR mortality \\n0.87; 95% CI, 0.68−1.11).\\nDuring the first 14 days of the study, the median daily duration of awake prone positioning was 5.0 \\nhours (IQR 1.6–8.8 hours).21 However, the median daily duration varied from 1.6 hours to 8.6 hours \\nacross the individual trials. Longer daily durations for awake prone positioning were associated with \\ntreatment success by Day 28. This study evaluated the incidences of certain adverse events, including \\nskin breakdown, vomiting, and central or arterial line dislodgment. These events occurred infrequently \\nduring the study, and the incidences were similar in each arm. No cardiac arrests occurred during awake \\nprone positioning.\\nThe optimal daily duration of awake prone positioning is unclear. In the meta-trial of awake prone \\npositioning, only 25 of 151 patients (17%) who had an average of ≥8 hours of awake prone positioning \\nper day met the primary endpoint of intubation or death when compared with 198 of 413 patients (48%) \\nwho remained in awake prone positioning for <8 hours per day.21 This result is consistent with past \\nclinical trials of prone positioning in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS, in which clinical \\nbenefits were observed after longer durations of prone positioning.15,16 \\nIntubation for Mechanical Ventilation\\nRecommendation\\n• If intubation becomes necessary, the procedure should be performed by an experienced \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

No studies have assessed the effect of recruitment \\nmaneuvers on oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS due to COVID-19. However, a systematic \\nreview and meta-analysis of 6 trials of recruitment maneuvers in patients with ARDS who did not have \\nCOVID-19 found that recruitment maneuvers reduced mortality, improved oxygenation 24 hours after \\nthe maneuver, and decreased the need for rescue therapy.32 Because recruitment maneuvers can cause \\nbarotrauma or hypotension, patients should be closely monitored during the maneuvers. If a patient \\ndecompensates during recruitment maneuvers, the maneuvers should be stopped immediately. \\nThe importance of properly performing recruitment maneuvers was illustrated by an analysis of 8 \\nrandomized controlled trials in patients without COVID-19 (n = 2,544) that found that recruitment \\nmaneuvers did not reduce in-hospital mortality (risk ratio 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78–1.04).23 However, a \\nsubgroup analysis found that traditional recruitment maneuvers significantly reduced in-hospital \\nmortality (risk ratio 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75–0.97). Mortality was higher among patients treated with \\nincremental PEEP titration recruitment maneuvers than among those treated with traditional recruitment \\nmaneuvers, but this difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio 1.06; 95% CI, 0.97–1.17).\\nThere are no prospective trials of pulmonary vasodilators in people with COVID-19. However, a meta-\\nanalysis of mostly small, retrospective trials did not show improved outcomes.33 A Cochrane review of \\n13 trials evaluated the use of inhaled nitric oxide in patients with ARDS who did not have COVID-19 \\nand found no reduction in mortality.34 Because the review showed a transient benefit for oxygenation, \\nit is reasonable to attempt using inhaled nitric oxide as a rescue therapy in patients with COVID-19 and \\nsevere ARDS after other options have failed. However, if the use of nitric oxide does not improve a \\npatient’s oxygenation, it should be tapered quickly to avoid rebound pulmonary vasoconstriction, which \\nmay occur when nitric oxide is discontinued after prolonged use.\\nReferences\\n1.

However, there is no conclusive evidence that ECMO is responsible for better clinical \\noutcomes, regardless of the cause of hypoxemic respiratory failure.1-4\\nThe clinical outcomes for patients with ARDS who are treated with ECMO are variable and depend \\non multiple factors, including the etiology of hypoxemic respiratory failure, the severity of pulmonary \\nand extrapulmonary illness, the presence of comorbidities, and the ECMO experience of the individual \\ncenter.5-7 Several multicenter, observational cohort studies from the first half of 20208-10 reported that \\npatients who required ECMO for COVID-19 had similar mortality to patients in a 2018 randomized \\nstudy who did not have COVID-19 but had ARDS and received ECMO.3\\nHowever, subsequent observational studies reported that in patients who required ECMO for COVID-19, \\noutcomes in late 2020 and early 2021 were worse than outcomes in spring 2020.11,12 The largest analysis \\nused data from 4,812 patients in the international Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry \\nwho had COVID-19 and received ECMO in 2020.11 At centers that provided ECMO throughout 2020, \\npatients who started ECMO before May 1, 2020, had a 90-day mortality of 36.9% after ECMO initiation \\n(95% CI, 34.1% to 39.7%). At the same centers, patients who initiated ECMO between May 2 and \\nDecember 31, 2020, had a 90-day mortality of 51.9% (95% CI, 50.0% to 53.8%). Furthermore, at \\ncenters that started using ECMO for patients with COVID-19 after May 1, 2020, the 90-day mortality \\nafter ECMO initiation was 58.9% (95% CI, 55.4% to 62.3%). These observational data should be \\ninterpreted with caution, as they may reflect a changing case mix of patients with COVID-19 who were \\nreferred for ECMO.\\nThree target emulation trials compared the efficacy of ECMO and conventional mechanical ventilation \\nin patients with severe COVID-19–associated ARDS.10,13,14 The largest of these trials included 844 \\npatients with COVID-19 who had hypoxemic respiratory failure and were receiving ECMO.14 The \\nstudy reported that the patients who received ECMO had lower 60-day mortality than the patients who \\nreceived only conventional mechanical ventilation (26% vs. 33.2%; risk difference −7.1%; 95% CI, \\n−8.2% to −6.1%; risk ratio 0.78; 95% CI, 0.75–0.82). Favorable ECMO outcomes were associated with \\nthe following factors: aged <65 years, a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired \\noxygen <80 mm Hg, ≤10-day duration of mechanical ventilation, and >15 cm H2O driving pressure.\\nUltimately, the benefits of ECMO cannot be clearly defined for patients with COVID-19 and severe \\nARDS because no randomized controlled trials have evaluated the use of ECMO in this population. \\nClinicians interested in pursuing ECMO for patients with COVID-19 and severe ARDS should consider \\ntransferring care to high-volume ECMO centers.

For patients with \\nCOVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU), treatment often requires managing underlying illnesses \\nother than COVID-19 that may have contributed to the need for ICU admission, as well as managing \\nCOVID-19 complications. Finally, prevention of ICU-related complications is critical to achieving \\noptimal clinical outcomes for any patient admitted to the ICU. \\nSelected Clinical Manifestations of COVID-19 Critical Illness \\nInflammatory Response \\nPatients with COVID-19 may develop a hyperinflammatory state, which appears to be distinct from \\nclassic “cytokine storm” syndromes (e.g., macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic \\narthritis, familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis). This hyperinflammatory state has been well \\ndescribed in adults but not in children.\\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\\nMIS-C is a rare, postinfectious complication of SARS-CoV-2 that is characterized by persistent fever, \\nsystemic inflammation, and multisystem organ dysfunction. The majority of children with MIS-C \\nrequire ICU-level care, primarily for shock and for vasopressor and inotropic support.1-3 For details on \\nthe definition of MIS-C, clinical features, and recommended treatments, see Special Considerations in \\nChildren and Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Children With MIS-C, Plus a Discussion on \\nMIS-A.\\nCardiac Dysfunction, Including Myocarditis\\nAlthough cardiac involvement is common in patients with MIS-C,2,4 cardiac manifestations have rarely \\nbeen described in children with acute COVID-19. Myocarditis, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and \\ncoronary artery aneurysms have been reported in patients with MIS-C. Myocarditis may also occur after \\nSARS-CoV-2 vaccination, particularly in adolescent males, although the clinical course generally is \\nrelatively mild.5 \\nThromboembolic Events \\nLimited data characterize the prevalence of thromboembolic disease in children with COVID-19 or \\nMIS-C. In a multicenter, retrospective cohort study including 814 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 \\nor MIS-C, thromboembolic events were detected in 2.1% of patients with COVID-19 and 6.5% of \\npatients with MIS-C.6 The same study conducted a multivariable analysis and found that the following \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Sedation management and considerations related to post-intensive \\ncare syndrome–pediatric (PICS-p) are discussed below. See Oxygenation and Ventilation for Children, \\nHemodynamic Considerations for Children, and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Children \\nfor more information on pediatric critical care. \\nSedation Management\\nGuidelines for the management of pain, agitation, neuromuscular blockade, delirium, and early mobility \\n(PANDEM) in infants and children admitted to the pediatric ICU have recently been published.12 In \\ngeneral, children with COVID-19 or MIS-C who require mechanical ventilation should be managed \\nper the usual principles of critical care for patients with respiratory failure who require mechanical \\nventilation. The usual care includes sedation with the minimal effective dose required to tolerate \\nmechanical ventilation, optimize gas exchange, and minimize the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. \\nUsing validated pain and sedation scales, the critical care team should set a sedation/pain target based on \\nthe phase of ventilation.\\nTwo large randomized controlled trials examined the use of protocols to manage sedation titration \\nin children receiving mechanical ventilation.13,14 In both studies, participants received usual care \\nor protocol-driven care implemented by nurses. Use of the protocols did not significantly reduce \\nthe duration of ventilation or affect other study outcomes. However, a patient’s risk of harm from \\nprotocolized sedation is generally low, which led the Society of Critical Care Medicine to issue a \\nconditional recommendation, based on low-level evidence, in its PANDEM clinical practice guidelines \\nfor the use of protocolized sedation in children who are critically ill and receiving mechanical \\nventilation.12 \\nStudies evaluating data on the effect of early mobility protocols on critically ill children are limited. \\nOne trial evaluated the safety and feasibility of early mobilization in 58 patients who were randomized \\nto receive usual care or early physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy consultation \\nwithin 72 hours of admission to the pediatric ICU.15 Although no differences between the arms \\nwere demonstrated for clinical, functional, or quality of life outcomes, the study found that the early \\nrehabilitation consultations were safe and feasible. \\nOngoing trials are measuring the effect of early mobilization on patient-centered outcomes in children \\nreceiving mechanical ventilation.

Given that the physiology observed in patients with MIS-C \\nresults from a combination of distributive, cardiogenic, and, occasionally, hypovolemic shock, the \\nCOVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) suggests that clinicians use the management \\nprinciples outlined in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign’s guidelines for children, as well as the \\nprinciples for clinical management of heart failure and general critical care, as appropriate. The Panel’s \\nrecommendations apply to the care of children and infants >37 weeks gestational age. \\nRecommendation\\n• For children with COVID-19 or MIS-C and shock, the Panel recommends targeting a mean arterial \\npressure (MAP) between the 5th and 50th percentiles for age or >50th percentile for age (AIII).\\nRationale\\nNo clinical trials support specific hemodynamic targets for children with septic shock due to COVID-19, \\nMIS-C, or any other etiology. The panel members for the pediatric Surviving Sepsis Campaign \\nguidelines were divided on the most appropriate MAP target and made no specific recommendation \\nfor a target MAP.2 Therefore, for children with COVID-19 or MIS-C and shock, clinicians should use \\nthe same approach used for children without COVID-19 and target a MAP between the 5th and 50th \\npercentiles for age or >50th percentile for age. When MAP cannot be reliably measured, systolic blood \\npressure is a reasonable alternative.\\nRecommendation\\n• The Panel recommends that, when available, a combination of serial clinical assessments; cardiac \\nultrasound or echocardiography; and laboratory markers, including lactate levels, should be used \\nto monitor the response to resuscitation in children with COVID-19 or MIS-C and shock (BIII). \\nRationale\\nObservational data from children with sepsis not related to COVID-19 suggest that using clinical \\nassessment alone limits the ability to classify patients with sepsis as having “warm” (i.e., likely to \\nrequire fluid or vasopressors) or “cold” (i.e., likely to require inotropes) shock, when compared with \\nassessments that include objective measures of cardiac output/index or systemic vascular resistance.6,7 \\nCardiac ultrasonography can be performed at the bedside and serially, and it may provide additional \\nclinical data on volume responsiveness and cardiac function.8 Data from studies evaluating the use \\nof cardiac ultrasound in children with COVID-19 and MIS-C are limited to reports from case series.9 \\nHowever, cardiac ultrasonography may have particular value when patients with MIS-C are being \\nmonitored, as these patients can exhibit a wide range of hemodynamic perturbations, and approximately \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

There was no difference in mortality \\nbetween the arms. Another randomized trial comparing balanced fluids to 0.9% saline is ongoing \\n(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04102371). \\nTwo observational studies used administrative data to compare the use of balanced/buffered crystalloids \\nwith 0.9% saline in propensity-matched cohorts of children with severe sepsis or septic shock not \\nrelated to COVID-19.14,15 One of the studies compared patients who received any or only Ringer’s \\nlactate solution in the first 3 days of admission with patients who received only normal saline.14 The \\nstudy demonstrated no differences between the arms for 30-day mortality or frequency of acute kidney \\ninjury. The other study compared patients receiving only balanced fluids with those receiving only 0.9% \\nsaline.15 The study demonstrated that the balanced fluid arm had lower mortality (12.5% vs. 15.9%; OR \\n0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.93; P = 0.007), reduced acute kidney injury (16.0% vs. 19.2%; OR 0.82; 95% \\nCI, 0.68–0.98; P = 0.028), and fewer days on vasoactive infusions (3.0 days vs. 3.3 days; P < 0.001) \\nthan the saline arm. No published studies focused on patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C, although \\nhyponatremia is common in patients with MIS-C, and decisions about the type of fluid therapy used \\nshould be individualized for this population. \\nRecommendations\\n• The Panel recommends the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine rather than dopamine in \\nchildren with COVID-19 or MIS-C and shock (BIIa). \\n• There is insufficient evidence to differentiate between norepinephrine and epinephrine as a \\nfirst-line vasoactive drug in children with COVID-19 or MIS-C.

However, given the \\nhigh prevalence of cardiac dysfunction in patients with MIS-C, clinicians should consider performing \\nechocardiography or cardiac ultrasound early in the initial resuscitation if MIS-C is suspected and \\nconsider initiating a vasoactive infusion if cardiac dysfunction is identified. \\nData from pediatric studies comparing vasopressors are limited, and there are no data specific to \\npatients with COVID-19 or MIS-C. Two small pediatric trials compared epinephrine with dopamine \\nin patients with fluid-refractory septic shock not related to COVID-19.16,17 One study randomized 63 \\nchildren to receive dopamine 5 to 10 µg/kg/min and 57 children to receive epinephrine 0.1 to 0.3 µg/\\nkg/min.16 Mortality by Day 28 was 14% in the dopamine arm and 7% in the epinephrine arm (OR 6.5; \\n95% CI, 1.1–37.8; P = 0.03). In the other study, 31 children were randomized to receive incremental \\ndoses of dopamine 10 to 20 µg/kg/min, and 29 children were randomized to receive incremental doses \\nof epinephrine 0.1 to 0.3 µg/kg/min.17 The primary outcome of shock resolution within 1 hour occurred \\nin 4 children (13%) receiving dopamine and 12 children (41%) receiving epinephrine (OR 4.8; 95% CI, \\n1.3–17.2; P = 0.019).\\nNo pediatric trials have compared norepinephrine to other vasoactive agents in patients with sepsis, but \\nbased on data from studies of adults, the pharmacologic properties of norepinephrine and dopamine (see \\nHemodynamics for Adults), and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for children, norepinephrine \\nis suggested over dopamine.2 \\nCollectively, this evidence is insufficient to recommend norepinephrine versus epinephrine as a first-line \\nvasoactive agent in children with COVID-19 or MIS-C. Further, given the varied physiology observed \\nwith MIS-C in particular, decisions about which vasopressor to use should be individualized based on \\nclinical and laboratory data and on findings from bedside cardiac ultrasound or echocardiography.\\nRecommendation\\n• There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of \\ninodilators (including dobutamine or milrinone) in children with COVID-19 or MIS-C who show \\nevidence of cardiac dysfunction and persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid loading and \\nthe use of vasopressor agents. \\nRationale\\nData from studies evaluating the use of inodilators in children in COVID-19, MIS-C, and non-COVID-\\n19-related sepsis are limited to reports from case series. However, the majority of the pediatric Surviving \\nSepsis Campaign guidelines panel (77%) would use an inodilator at least some of the time for patients \\nwith sepsis not related to COVID-19, cardiac dysfunction, and persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate \\nfluid loading and the use of vasopressor agents.2 Expert consultation from specialists in pediatric \\ncardiology and critical care medicine is recommended in this scenario. \\nAdditional Recommendations\\n• For the acute resuscitation of children with COVID-19 or MIS-C and shock, the Panel \\nrecommends the use of crystalloids rather than albumin (AIIb).\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

However, there is no evidence that the \\ntarget SpO2 should differ from the 2023 PALICC-2 recommendation.1 An SpO2 of 92% to 97% is \\nrecommended for most children with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen. The potential harm \\nof hyperoxia in children was demonstrated in a meta-analysis of 11 observational studies of children \\nwithout COVID-19.2 The study demonstrated that critically ill children with hyperoxia had greater odds \\nof mortality than those without hyperoxia (OR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.00–2.51). However, across the included \\nstudies, there was significant heterogeneity for populations, definitions of hyperoxia, and the timing of \\nassessments for mortality outcomes. For children with severe PARDS, an SpO2 <92% can be considered \\nto minimize exposure to a high FiO2.1 Although no evidence clearly identifies a safe minimum SpO2 \\nin children, prolonged exposure to an SpO2 <88% should be avoided. When a patient’s SpO2 is <92%, \\nmonitoring oxygen delivery markers, including central venous SpO2, is suggested.3 \\nThe limitations of currently available measurement devices should be considered when using pulse \\noximetry to manage children with COVID-19 or PARDS. Observational studies in children have \\nreported that pulse oximetry may be inaccurate, particularly at lower oxygen saturations (≤90%) and \\nfor children who are Black.4,5 These reports are consistent with several observational studies in adults \\nthat identified inaccuracies in pulse oximetry measurements, particularly for patients with darker skin \\npigmentation.6-8 See Clinical Spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 Infection for more information.\\nAlthough procedures vary across institutions, the treatment of most patients with PARDS is managed \\nwithout the use of arterial lines or arterial blood gas testing because arterial line placement in children, \\nespecially young children, can result in complications.9-11 Clinicians should monitor for adequate \\ndelivery of oxygen or consider lowering the threshold for arterial line placement if a patient’s SpO2 \\nmeasurements could be unreliable (e.g., for children who have darker skin or low SpO2 levels). \\nMonitoring methods could include observing the patient for altered mentation, measuring venous \\noxygen saturation, or using near-infrared spectroscopy. \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Both the Surviving Sepsis \\nCampaign International Guidelines for the Management of Septic Shock and Sepsis-Associated \\nOrgan Dysfunction in Children and the 2023 PALICC-2 recommend the use of NIV for children with \\nrespiratory failure who have no indication for intubation.12,13 \\nFurthermore, the response to NIV , particularly in children with more severe hypoxemia or high work \\nof breathing, should be gauged early (within the first several hours).13 If the patient does not show \\nimprovement, intubation should be considered. To unload respiratory muscles, bilevel modes of NIV (with \\ninspiratory pressure augmentation, such as BiPAP), if tolerated, are preferred over the use of continuous \\npositive airway pressure (CPAP) alone, although CPAP is an alternative for children who cannot achieve an \\nadequate seal with the NIV interface or who have significant patient-ventilator asynchrony.\\nHFNC oxygen is a relatively new, but increasingly used, mode of respiratory support for infants and \\nchildren with acute respiratory failure.14 Data from studies evaluating the effectiveness of HFNC \\noxygen relative to NIV or conventional oxygen are limited to studies of children with pneumonia in \\nlimited-resource settings and to studies of children with bronchiolitis. Two randomized controlled trials \\nof children with pneumonia were conducted in limited-resource settings. One study demonstrated a \\nslightly lower relative risk of mortality with the use of HFNC oxygen when compared with conventional \\noxygen therapy (aHR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.54–1.16), although the results were not statistically significant.15 \\nThe other trial randomized patients to receive bubble CPAP, low-flow oxygen, or HFNC oxygen.16 \\nThe children who received bubble CPAP demonstrated a lower risk of mortality than the children who \\nreceived low-flow oxygen (relative risk 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07–0.89; P = 0.02). The results also indicated \\nthat for the composite outcome of treatment failure, there was no difference between the use of bubble \\nCPAP and HFNC oxygen (relative risk 0.50; 99.7% CI, 0.11–2.29).\\nA randomized, noninferiority trial compared HFNC oxygen (2 L/kg/min) and nasal CPAP among \\n142 infants aged <6 months with bronchiolitis not caused by COVID-19.17 The primary outcome was \\ntreatment failure within 24 hours, defined as an increase of ≥1 point in the modified Wood’s Clinical \\nAsthma Score or Échelle Douleur Inconfort Nouveau-Né (EDIN) score (a neonatal pain and discomfort \\nscale), a respiratory rate >60 breaths/min and an increase of >10 breaths/min from baseline, or >2 severe \\napnea episodes per hour. Treatment failure occurred more often in the HFNC oxygen arm than in the \\nnasal CPAP arm (51% vs. 31%), a result that failed to meet the prespecified noninferiority margin. \\nNotably, in the HFNC oxygen arm, 72% of the patients who had treatment failure were managed \\nsuccessfully with nasal CPAP, and there were no differences between the arms for intubation rates or \\nlength of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The Panel’s \\nrecommendations are derived from the 2023 PALICC-2 recommendations.1 \\nA large observational study conducted in 71 international pediatric ICUs reported that for patients with \\nmild to moderate ARDS, less adherence to the recommended VT of 5 to 8 mL/kg (or 3 to 6 mL/kg for \\npatients with severe ARDS) was associated with higher mortality and with more time on ventilation.25 \\nIn general, supraphysiologic VT ventilation (>8 mL/kg) should not be used in patients with PARDS, and \\nVT should be adjusted within the acceptable range to maintain other lung-protective ventilation targets \\n(e.g., maintaining ≤28 cm H2O plateau pressure). The use of ultra-low VT ventilation (<4 mL/kg) has \\nnot been systematically studied in children, so it should be used with caution. \\nThe ARDS Network established a ventilation protocol that includes suggested low PEEP/high FiO2 \\nvalues.26 Two observational studies reported better clinical outcomes associated with use of the \\nsuggested (or higher) PEEP levels when compared with lower PEEP levels.25,27 The multicenter studies, \\nwhich included nearly 1,500 pediatric patients with ARDS, demonstrated that PEEP levels lower than \\nthose suggested by the ARDS Network were associated with increased mortality. \\nDriving pressure (i.e., the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP) is a marker for lung strain. \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In a small, randomized trial, the use of inhaled nitric oxide resulted in reduced use of \\nextracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).30 However, inhaled nitric oxide has a heterogeneous \\ntreatment effect, and many patients do not show improved gas exchange. Although adverse effects are \\nrare, use of inhaled nitric oxide can have a substantial effect on health care costs. Therefore, inhaled nitric \\noxide should not be considered routine therapy for children with PARDS or COVID-19 who are receiving \\nmechanical ventilation. \\nFluid Management in Children With PARDS\\nRecommendation\\n• Following an initial resuscitation in children with PARDS due to COVID-19, clinicians should \\nmonitor and titrate fluid balance to maintain adequate intravascular volume while aiming to prevent \\npositive fluid balance (BIIb).\\nRationale\\nThere is no evidence that fluid management in patients with PARDS due to COVID-19 should differ from \\nfluid management in patients with PARDS due to other causes. Therefore, the Panel’s recommendation \\naligns with the 2023 PALICC-2 recommendations.1 No pediatric randomized trials have directly compared \\na liberal fluid strategy to a conservative fluid strategy in patients with PARDS of any etiology. Several \\nobservational studies have demonstrated an association between greater fluid overload and worse clinical \\noutcomes, including fewer ventilator-free days and increased mortality.31-33 \\nIn a multicenter study of 168 children with acute lung injury, daily and cumulative fluid balance \\nwere measured over the first 7 days after participants met the inclusion criteria.31 After adjusting for \\ndemographic characteristics, pediatric risk of mortality III (PRISM III) scores, vasopressor use, and the \\nratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), the study found that \\nan increasing cumulative fluid balance on Day 3 was associated with fewer ventilator-free days, but no \\nassociation with mortality was detected. \\nA more recent single-center study that included 732 children with acute lung injury demonstrated \\nan association between higher cumulative fluid balance on Days 5 to 7 and increased mortality (OR \\n1.34 for 100 mL/kg on Day 5; 95% CI, 1.11–1.61) after adjusting for oxygenation index, the number \\nof nonpulmonary organ failures, immunocompromised status, and vasopressor scores.33 Also, greater \\ncumulative fluid balance on Days 4 to 7 was associated with a lower probability of successful extubation \\nby Day 28. \\nCollectively, the findings from these pediatric observational studies demonstrate the potential harm of \\nfluid overload in patients with PARDS, particularly after 3 to 4 days of illness. These results are consistent \\nwith the findings from FACTT, a trial of conservative versus liberal fluid management strategies in \\nadults.34 In adults, FACTT found no difference between the arms for 60-day mortality, but the conservative \\nstrategy arm demonstrated improved oxygenation and less time on mechanical ventilation and in the ICU \\nwhen compared with the liberal strategy arm.

Therefore, the \\nPanel’s recommendations are based on the 2023 PALICC-2 recommendations.1 \\nOne randomized controlled trial and 2 propensity-matched, observational studies in the past 10 years \\nevaluated the use of inhaled nitric oxide in patients with PARDS.30,35,36 The randomized controlled trial \\nincluded 55 patients and found that the use of inhaled nitric oxide resulted in no statistical difference \\nbetween the arms for 28-day mortality (8% mortality in the inhaled nitric oxide arm vs. 28% in the \\nplacebo arm), although the trial was underpowered for this outcome.30 However, the inhaled nitric oxide \\narm had approximately 5 more ventilator-free days than the placebo arm, a result that was primarily \\nmediated by avoiding the use of ECMO. \\nResults from observational studies have shown that patients who received inhaled nitric oxide did \\nnot improve or have fewer ventilator-free days.35,36 A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Therefore, the Panel’s recommendation to consider prone positioning in \\ncases of severe PARDS aligns with the 2023 PALICC-2 recommendation and is supported by data from \\nstudies in adults, primarily from PROSEV A, a trial on prone positioning in patients with ARDS.38\\nThe 2023 PALICC-2 does not recommend for or against recruitment maneuvers.1 However, the Panel \\nsuggests using careful incremental and decremental adjustments in PEEP if these maneuvers are applied \\nin children with refractory hypoxemia. In children, this approach to recruitment maneuvers is preferred \\nover sustained inflation maneuvers due to the increased risk of harm from barotrauma and hemodynamic \\ncompromise in patients with sustained inflation.

Several observational studies that used propensity \\nmatching reported no difference in outcomes between the HFOV and conventional ventilation arms \\nor reported a potential for higher mortality or longer ventilation time with the use of HFOV when \\ncompared with conventional ventilation.44-48 In some of these analyses, residual confounding has been a \\nconcern. Therefore, the Panel determined that there is insufficient evidence to recommend either for or \\nagainst the use of HFOV in patients with PARDS due to COVID-19. Some concerns have been raised \\nabout the use of HFOV and the aerosolization of COVID-19; however, adding a filter to the expiratory \\nlimb of the HFOV circuit may alleviate these concerns. \\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children \\nMore than half of the patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) require \\nmechanical ventilation or NIV .49-51 For patients with MIS-C, the indications for mechanical ventilation \\nvary and include shock or cardiac dysfunction, pulmonary edema, procedural preparation (e.g., to \\nfacilitate sedation for central venous catheter placement), respiratory failure, or neurologic failure.

Candidacy for ECMO should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the \\nmultidisciplinary team. \\nRationale\\nECMO is used as a rescue therapy for children with refractory hypoxemia or shock. Similar to outcomes \\nfor adults, outcomes for children managed with venovenous ECMO are variable and influenced by the \\netiology and duration of the respiratory failure and by underlying, comorbid medical conditions.1,2 In \\naddition, studies have shown that pediatric centers that treat fewer patients with ECMO have worse \\noutcomes than facilities that treat a high volume of patients with ECMO.3,4 Other than studies of \\nneonates, no randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy or benefit of ECMO for the treatment of \\nhypoxemic respiratory failure in children without COVID-19. In an observational study of 122 children \\nwith severe pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS), children who received ECMO and \\nthose supported without ECMO had similar 90-day mortality (25% vs. 30%).5 \\nThe 2023 Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference suggests that patients with severe PARDS \\nfrom potentially reversible causes and children who are candidates for lung transplantation be evaluated \\nfor management with ECMO if lung-protective strategies result in inadequate ventilation (conditional \\nrecommendation, very low quality of evidence).6 The Surviving Sepsis Campaign International \\nGuidelines for the Management of Septic Shock and Sepsis-Associated Organ Dysfunction in Children \\nissued a weak recommendation, based on very low-quality evidence, for the use of venovenous ECMO \\nin children with PARDS and refractory hypoxemia.7 \\nVenoarterial ECMO has been used successfully for the treatment of refractory shock in children, \\nalthough no trials have evaluated this approach, and the potential benefits must be weighed against risks \\nof bleeding and thromboembolic events.8-10 The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for children \\nissued a weak recommendation, based on very low-quality evidence, for the use of venoarterial ECMO \\nin children with refractory shock who have not improved with any other treatments.7 However, a \\nstandardized definition for refractory shock in children is not available.\\nStudies that have evaluated data on the use of ECMO in children with COVID-19 and MIS-C have \\nsuggested that these patients have outcomes similar to patients who have received ECMO for illnesses \\nnot related to COVID-19.11-15 The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization published guidelines for \\nthe use of ECMO in patients with COVID-19.16 In general, children with COVID-19 or MIS-C who are \\ncandidates for ECMO should be assessed using criteria similar to those used for children with severe \\nrespiratory failure or shock due to other causes. Cannulation approaches and management principles \\nshould follow published international guidelines and local protocols for patients who do not have \\nCOVID-19.

It binds to the viral RNA-dependent RNA \\npolymerase and inhibits viral replication by terminating RNA transcription prematurely. Remdesivir has \\ndemonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against SARS-CoV-2.1 \\nIntravenous remdesivir is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment \\nof COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients aged ≥28 days and weighing ≥3 kg. In nonhospitalized \\npatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progressing to severe disease, \\nremdesivir should be started within 7 days of symptom onset and administered for 3 days. Hospitalized \\npatients should receive remdesivir for 5 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first.2 The \\nFDA prescribing information for remdesivir indicates that if a patient does not clinically improve within \\n5 days, clinicians may extend the treatment course for up to 5 additional days (for a total duration of 10 \\ndays). See Table 4e for more information on administering remdesivir. \\nRemdesivir has been studied in several clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The \\nrecommendations from the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) are based on the results \\nof these studies. See Table 4a for more information.\\nRecommendations\\n• For the Panel’s recommendations and information on the clinical efficacy of using remdesivir \\nto treat high-risk, nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, see Therapeutic \\nManagement of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19. \\n• For the Panel’s recommendations and information on the clinical efficacy of using remdesivir with \\nor without immunomodulators to treat certain hospitalized patients, see Therapeutic Management \\nof Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19. \\nMonitoring, Adverse Effects, and Drug-Drug Interactions\\nRemdesivir can cause gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea), elevated transaminase levels, an increase \\nin prothrombin time without a change in the international normalized ratio, and hypersensitivity \\nreactions. Bradycardia has also been reported.3,4\\nThe FDA approved remdesivir for use without dose adjustment in patients with an estimated glomerular \\nfiltration rate (eGFR) of <30 mL/min, including those receiving dialysis.2 Remdesivir is formulated with \\nsulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBECD) sodium. SBECD is a vehicle that is primarily eliminated \\nthrough the kidneys. Accumulation of SBECD in patients with renal impairment may result in liver \\nand renal toxicities. The REDPINE trial evaluated the use of remdesivir for 5 days in patients with \\nCOVID-19 and an eGFR of <30 mL/min, and a Phase 1 trial evaluated the use of a single dose of \\nremdesivir in individuals with different degrees of renal impairment. Neither trial reported significant \\nsafety concerns. \\nBefore starting patients on remdesivir, the FDA recommends performing liver function and prothrombin \\ntime tests as clinically appropriate and repeating these tests during treatment as clinically indicated. \\nRemdesivir may need to be discontinued if a patient’s alanine transaminase level increases to >10 times \\nthe upper limit of normal, and it should be discontinued if increases in alanine transaminase levels and \\nsigns or symptoms of liver inflammation are observed.2\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

There is concern that using a single antiviral agent \\nin these patients may result in the emergence of resistant virus.5 Additional studies are needed to assess \\nthis risk. The data on using combinations of antiviral therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 are \\nlimited.6 Clinical trials are needed to determine the role of combination therapy in treating patients with \\nCOVID-19.\\nFor patients who are immunocompromised and have prolonged COVID-19 symptoms and evidence \\nof ongoing viral replication (e.g., those with a low cycle threshold value, as measured by a reverse \\ntranscription polymerase chain reaction result or with a positive rapid antigen test result) despite \\nreceiving a course of antiviral therapy, the optimal management is unknown. Case reports and case \\nseries have documented treating these patients with additional antiviral treatments, prolonged courses of \\nantiviral treatments, high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma, or combination therapy.7-11 \\nFor more information on the use of remdesivir in patients who are moderately to severely \\nimmunocompromised, see Special Considerations in People Who Are Immunocompromised, \\nTherapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19, and Therapeutic Management of \\nNonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19. \\nConsiderations in Pregnant and Lactating People\\nSee Pregnancy, Lactation, and COVID-19 Therapeutics for the Panel’s guidance regarding the use of \\nremdesivir during pregnancy and lactation. \\nConsiderations in Children\\nSee Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Children With COVID-19 and Therapeutic \\nManagement of Hospitalized Children With COVID-19 for the Panel’s guidance regarding the use of \\nremdesivir in children. \\nReferences\\n1.

Coadministration of ritonavir is required to \\nincrease nirmatrelvir concentrations to the target therapeutic range. \\nRitonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the \\ntreatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk of progressing to severe \\nCOVID-19.3 The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir will continue \\nto authorize the use of the EUA-labeled product for the treatment of nonhospitalized adolescents aged 12 \\nto 17 years and weighing ≥40 kg who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. \\nRecommendations \\n• The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends using nirmatrelvir 300 mg \\nwith ritonavir 100 mg (Paxlovid) orally (PO) twice daily for 5 days in nonhospitalized adults \\nwith mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of disease progression (AIIa). Treatment \\nshould be initiated as soon as possible and within 5 days of symptom onset. For information \\non medical conditions that confer high risk, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \\nwebpage Underlying Medical Conditions Associated With Higher Risk for Severe COVID-19.\\n• Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is available through an FDA EUA for the treatment of mild to \\nmoderate COVID-19 in nonhospitalized adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and weighing ≥40 kg.4 \\nFor recommendations on using ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir in nonhospitalized children with \\nCOVID-19, see Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Children With COVID-19.\\n• See the section titled Considerations in Patients With Severe Renal Insufficiency below for \\ninformation on managing patients with COVID-19 and severe renal insufficiency.\\n• For a discussion of the treatment of prolonged, symptomatic COVID-19 in patients with evidence \\nof ongoing SARS-CoV-2 replication, see the section titled Patients Who Are Immunocompromised \\nand Have Prolonged COVID-19 Symptoms and Evidence of Ongoing Viral Replication below. \\nRationale\\nThe EPIC-HR trial enrolled nonhospitalized adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were not \\nvaccinated and who were at high risk of progressing to severe disease.5 The trial demonstrated that \\nstarting ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir within 5 days of symptom onset in these patients reduced the risk \\nof hospitalization or death through Day 28 by 89% compared to placebo. This efficacy is comparable \\nto remdesivir (87% relative reduction)6 and greater than the efficacy reported for molnupiravir (31% \\nrelative reduction).7 However, these agents have not been directly compared in clinical trials. \\nAlthough ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir demonstrated a clinical benefit during the EPIC-HR trial, the \\nbenefits in unvaccinated people who are at low risk of progression to severe disease or in vaccinated \\npeople who are at high risk of progression to severe disease are unclear. The EPIC-SR trial, which \\nincluded both of these populations, found that ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir did not reduce the duration \\nof symptoms and did not have a statistically significant effect on the risk of hospitalization or death \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

See Drug-Drug Interactions Between Ritonavir-\\nBoosted Nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and Concomitant Medications for details.\\nDrug-Drug Interactions\\nThe FDA prescribing information for ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir includes a boxed warning about \\nsignificant drug-drug interactions between ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and other medications. These \\ninteractions are primarily caused by the ritonavir component of the combination. Ritonavir, a strong \\nCYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, may increase the blood concentration of certain \\nconcomitant medications and increase the potential for serious drug toxicities. Before prescribing \\nritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, clinicians should carefully review the patient’s concomitant medications, \\nincluding over-the-counter medications, herbal supplements, and recreational drugs, to evaluate \\npotential drug-drug interactions. Clinicians should consider both the potential benefits of treatment with \\nritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and the potential risks related to drug-drug interactions. Many drug-drug \\ninteractions between ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and concomitant medications (e.g., certain statins, \\ncalcium channel blockers, or direct oral anticoagulants) can be safely managed. For the Panel’s \\nrecommendations on preferred and alternative antiviral therapies for outpatients with COVID-19, see \\nTherapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19. Clinicians should be aware that \\nthe drug-drug interaction potential of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir may change if it is used for extended \\ndurations (i.e., ≥10 days).\\nThe following resources provide information on identifying and managing drug-drug interactions.\\n• Quick reference lists:\\n• Drug-Drug Interactions Between Ritonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and Concomitant \\nMedications.

There are also insufficient data \\non the efficacy of administering a second course of antiviral therapy to treat viral rebound or symptom \\nrecurrence. However, a clinical trial that is evaluating the use of a second course of ritonavir-boosted \\nnirmatrelvir to treat patients with viral rebound and symptom recurrence is underway (ClinicalTrials.gov \\nIdentifier NCT05567952).\\nSARS-CoV-2 Resistance\\nViral mutations that lead to substantial resistance to nirmatrelvir have been selected for in in vitro \\nstudies; the fitness of these mutations is unclear. Surveillance for the emergence of significant resistance \\nto nirmatrelvir is critical, particularly in patients who are severely immunocompromised and who \\nexperience prolonged replication of SARS-CoV-2. \\nAdditional Considerations \\n• Nirmatrelvir must be administered with ritonavir to achieve sufficient therapeutic plasma \\nconcentrations.\\n• In patients with moderate renal impairment (i.e., those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate \\n[eGFR] of ≥30 to <60 mL/min), the dose should be reduced to nirmatrelvir 150 mg with ritonavir \\n100 mg PO twice daily.\\n• Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is not recommended for patients with known or suspected severe \\nhepatic impairment (i.e., Child-Pugh Class C), and it should be used with caution in patients with \\npre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis.

The recommended treatment course \\nof ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir for COVID-19 is 5 days. CYP3A4 inhibition occurs rapidly, with \\nmaximum inhibition occurring within 48 hours of ritonavir initiation.1 After treatment is completed and \\nritonavir is discontinued, 70% to 90% of CYP3A4 inhibition resolves within 2 to 3 days.2 The time to \\nresolution of inhibition varies based on factors such as the patient’s age; therefore, resolution may take \\nlonger in some individuals, such as in adults of advanced age. \\nRitonavir is also an inhibitor of CYP2D6, P-gp, and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) \\n1B1. When used for longer durations or chronically, ritonavir may induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, \\nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, and uridine diphosphate-glucuronyltransferase (UGT).\\nNirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP3A4 substrates. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should not be given \\nwithin 2 weeks of administering a strong CYP3A4 inducer (e.g., St. John’s wort, rifampin). Ritonavir-\\nboosted nirmatrelvir is contraindicated in this setting because the delayed offset of enzyme induction \\nmay reduce the concentrations of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, rendering the treatment ineffective against \\nSARS-CoV-2.

The available genotoxicity data and the 5-day duration of treatment led the \\nFDA to conclude that molnupiravir has a low risk for genotoxicity. \\nRecommendations \\n• The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends using molnupiravir 800 \\nmg orally (PO) twice daily for 5 days as an alternative therapy in nonhospitalized patients aged \\n≥18 years with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of disease progression when \\nritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and remdesivir are not available, feasible to use, or \\nclinically appropriate; treatment should be initiated as soon as possible and within 5 days of \\nsymptom onset (CIIa).\\n• The Panel recommends against the use of molnupiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 in \\npregnant patients unless there are no other options and therapy is clearly indicated (AIII). For \\nmore details, see Considerations in Pregnant and Lactating People below.\\n• People who engage in sexual activity that may result in conception should use effective \\ncontraception during and following treatment with molnupiravir. For more details, see \\nConsiderations in Sexually Active Individuals below.\\nMolnupiravir may be used in patients who are hospitalized for a diagnosis other than COVID-19, \\nprovided they have mild to moderate COVID-19 and are at high risk of progressing to severe disease. \\nFor the Panel’s recommendations on preferred and alternative antiviral therapies for outpatients with \\nCOVID-19, see Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19.  \\nRationale\\nThe MOVe-OUT trial enrolled high-risk, unvaccinated, nonhospitalized adults and reported that \\nmolnupiravir reduced the rate of hospitalization or death among these patients by 31% compared to \\nplacebo.7 A secondary analysis of patients who required hospitalization during the trial found a reduced \\nneed for respiratory interventions among those who received molnupiravir compared to those who \\nreceived placebo.8 MOVe-OUT was conducted before the emergence of the Omicron subvariants.\\nThe PANORAMIC trial enrolled nonhospitalized adults with COVID-19 who were at high risk of severe \\ndisease during a period when the Omicron variant was circulating.9 Ninety-four percent of the patients \\nhad received at least 3 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. The study found that the use of molnupiravir plus \\nusual care did not reduce the occurrence of the primary composite outcome of hospitalization or death \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The proportion of patients who met this composite outcome was 1% in \\nboth arms. Molnupiravir plus usual care was superior to usual care alone for several secondary clinical \\nendpoints. For example, the time to self-reported recovery was substantially shorter in people who \\nreceived molnupiravir plus usual care than in people who received usual care alone (median of 9 days \\nvs. 15 days). Because the PANORAMIC trial was an open-label study with self-reported symptoms, the \\nfindings are less reliable than those from a placebo-controlled trial.\\nFor more information on the MOVe-Out and PANORAMIC trials, see the Clinical Data section below.\\nAlthough the different COVID-19 treatment options have not been directly compared in clinical trials, \\nthe Panel recommends using molnupiravir only when ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and remdesivir \\nare not available, feasible to use, or clinically appropriate (CIIa). Molnupiravir appears to have lower \\nclinical efficacy than these other treatment options. \\nSome observational studies have evaluated the use of molnupiravir in nonhospitalized or hospitalized \\nadults who are at high risk of progressing to severe disease, including some patients who received \\nCOVID-19 vaccines, but these studies have limitations.10-12 For treatment considerations for vaccinated \\nindividuals, see Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19. \\nAdditional Considerations\\n• Patients should complete the 5-day treatment course of molnupiravir. It is unknown whether \\na shorter course is less effective or associated with the emergence of molnupiravir-resistant \\nmutations. \\n• If a patient requires hospitalization after starting treatment, the full treatment course of \\nmolnupiravir can be completed at the health care provider’s discretion.\\n• The FDA EUA for molnupiravir provides instructions for preparing and administering capsule \\ncontents through orogastric or nasogastric tubes.6 \\n• There are no data on using combinations of antiviral therapies to treat nonhospitalized patients \\nwith COVID-19. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether combination therapy has a role in \\nthe treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\\n• Patients who are severely immunocompromised can experience prolonged periods of \\nSARS-CoV-2 replication, which may lead to rapid viral evolution. There are theoretical concerns \\nthat using a single antiviral agent in these patients may produce antiviral-resistant viruses. \\nAdditional studies are needed to assess this risk. The role of combination antiviral therapy \\nin treating patients who are severely immunocompromised is not yet known. See Special \\nConsiderations in People Who Are Immunocompromised for more information. \\n• There are limited data on the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 rebound in patients who have completed \\ntreatment with molnupiravir.13 During the MOVe-OUT trial, rates of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 \\nrebound were low (approximately 1%) in both those who received molnupiravir and those who \\nreceived placebo.6 \\n• SARS-CoV-2 sequences with molnupiravir-induced mutations have been detected in many \\ncountries, but the clinical implications of these mutations remain unclear.14\\nMonitoring, Adverse Effects, and Drug-Drug Interactions \\nThe most common adverse effects of molnupiravir are diarrhea, nausea, and dizziness. Based on in vitro \\nstudies, neither molnupiravir nor its active metabolite NHC are inhibitors or inducers of major drug-\\nmetabolizing enzymes or inhibitors of major drug transporters. \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

No randomized, adequately powered trials that evaluated the use of CCP \\nfor the treatment of COVID-19 in these patients have been published. Some subgroup analyses generated \\nfrom clinical trials that enrolled patients who were immunocompromised suggested a potential benefit of \\nusing CCP in this population.5-7 However, subgroup analyses need to be interpreted with caution. In the \\noverall trial populations, there was no evidence of a benefit of CCP. Other clinical data from case series, \\nretrospective case-control studies, and meta-analyses have been cited as support for the potential benefit \\nof CCP in patients who are immunocompromised. However, the patient populations differed across \\nstudies, and the studies had design limitations, making the findings difficult to interpret.8-16 \\nThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants further complicates the assessment of the benefits of using \\nCCP. Although results from some in vitro studies suggest that CCP collected from vaccinated individuals \\nwho recovered from COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant exhibits neutralizing activity against \\ncertain Omicron subvariants,17-23 extrapolation of these results to the clinical setting is challenging for \\nthe following reasons:24 \\n• COVID-19 immune responses across donor populations are heterogeneous; thus, CCP products \\nare variable. \\n• The tests used to qualify high-titer CCP measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers. They do not \\ndirectly measure neutralizing activity or account for currently circulating subvariants.\\n• Published in vitro studies that evaluated the virologic activity of CCP against the currently \\ncirculating variants used a variety of assays that are difficult to compare and interpret.20-23,25-27 \\n• The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of individual CCP products are not clearly \\nunderstood; therefore, determining the clinical relevance of a degree of in vitro neutralization \\nactivity is difficult. \\nIn this context, the Panel has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to definitively recommend \\nthe use of CCP for the treatment of COVID-19 in people who are immunocompromised. For patients \\nwho are immunocompromised and have prolonged COVID-19 symptoms and evidence of ongoing \\nviral replication (e.g., those with a low cycle threshold value, as measured by a reverse transcription \\npolymerase chain reaction result or with a positive rapid antigen test result) despite receiving a course \\nof antiviral therapy, the optimal management is unknown. Case reports and case series have described \\nthe treatment of these patients with additional antiviral treatments, prolonged courses of antiviral \\ntreatments, high-titer CCP, or combination therapy.28-34 The data for these approaches are not definitive, \\nbut some Panel members would use longer and/or additional courses of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir or \\nremdesivir, high-titer CCP, or combinations of these. If CCP is used, clinicians should attempt to obtain \\nhigh-titer CCP from a vaccinated donor who recently recovered from COVID-19 likely caused by a \\nSARS-CoV-2 variant similar to the variant causing the patient’s illness.\\nAdequately powered, well-designed, and well-conducted randomized clinical trials are needed to \\nprovide more specific, evidence-based guidance on the role of CCP in the treatment of COVID-19 in \\npatients who are immunocompromised.\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

All 3 were open-label trials that were stopped early due to \\nfutility. However, an open-label randomized trial that enrolled patients with COVID-19–induced acute \\nrespiratory distress syndrome who required mechanical ventilation showed a lower mortality among \\npatients who received high-titer CCP than among those who received standard care.37 The benefit \\nwas primarily seen among patients who received CCP within 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. \\nAlmost all of the patients (98%) received corticosteroids during the trial, but only a few received a \\nsecond immunomodulator or were previously vaccinated against COVID-19.

The rationale for this recommendation is based on the evidence \\nfrom the 4 large randomized controlled trials, the widespread, pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in \\nthe population, the continuously evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the availability of other antiviral \\nagents (e.g., remdesivir).\\nNonhospitalized Patients Who Are Immunocompetent\\nCCP is not authorized for the treatment of COVID-19 in nonhospitalized patients who do not have \\nimmunosuppressive disease or who are not receiving immunosuppressive treatments.\\nData from well-designed clinical trials that evaluated the use of CCP for the treatment of nonhospitalized \\npatients with COVID-19 prior to the emergence of the Omicron variants are conflicting. These data are \\nsummarized in Table 4c.

These \\nrisks include transfusion-transmitted infections (e.g., HIV , hepatitis B, hepatitis C), allergic reactions, \\nanaphylactic reactions, febrile nonhemolytic reactions, transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-\\nassociated circulatory overload, and hemolytic reactions.

Interferon beta-1a \\nhas been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat relapsing forms of multiple \\nsclerosis, and pegylated formulations of interferon alfa-2a and interferon alfa-2b have been approved \\nby the FDA to treat hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections. Several interferons, including interferon \\nalfa, beta, and lambda, have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19. Interferon lambda is not \\ncurrently approved or authorized by the FDA for any use. \\nRecommendations\\n• For nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, the COVID-19 Treatment \\nGuidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends against the use of interferon alfa or beta, except in a \\nclinical trial (AIIa). \\n• For hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the Panel recommends against the use of systemic \\ninterferon alfa, except in a clinical trial (AIIa).\\n• For hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the Panel recommends against the use of systemic \\ninterferon beta (AI).\\n• The Panel is unable to recommend either for or against the use of interferon lambda because this \\nproduct is not currently available for clinical use.\\nRationale\\nInterferon Alfa and Beta\\nMany of the studies that evaluated the use of systemic interferons for the treatment of hospitalized \\nadults with COVID-19 were conducted in early 2020, before the widespread use of remdesivir or \\ncorticosteroids and other immunomodulators. In addition, these studies administered interferons with \\nother drugs that have since been shown to have no clinical benefit in people with COVID-19, such as \\nlopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine.1-3 \\nMore recent studies have shown no benefit of using interferon beta-1a to treat patients with COVID-19, \\nand some of the trials have suggested that interferon beta-1a can cause harm in patients with severe \\ndisease, such as those who require high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, or mechanical \\nventilation.4,5 In a large randomized controlled trial of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the \\ncombination of interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir showed no clinical benefit when compared to \\nremdesivir alone.4 Similarly, the World Health Organization Solidarity trial did not show a benefit \\nof administering interferon beta-1a to hospitalized patients, approximately 50% of whom were on \\ncorticosteroids.5 \\nSystemic interferon alfa and inhaled interferons have also been evaluated in patients with COVID-19. \\nThe trials that have evaluated the use of interferon alfa have generally been small or moderate in size \\nand have not been adequately powered to assess whether this agent provides a clinical benefit for \\npatients with COVID-19.6-8\\nInterferon Lambda\\nPegylated interferon lambda was studied in a randomized, double-blind, adaptive clinical trial that \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Patients with a high baseline SARS-CoV-2 viral load who received interferon \\nlambda were more likely to have cleared the virus by Day 7 than those who received placebo. \\nThe drug was generally well tolerated. However, since pegylated interferon lambda is an investigational \\nagent that is not currently available for clinical use, the Panel cannot make a recommendation for its use \\nat this time.\\nSummaries of the studies that informed the Panel’s recommendations can be found in Table 4d.\\nConsiderations in Pregnant People\\nAccording to analyses of data from several large pregnancy registries, exposure to interferon beta-1b \\nprior to conception or during pregnancy does not lead to an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes \\n(e.g., spontaneous abortion, congenital anomaly).10,11 In a study that used data from pregnancy registries \\nin Sweden and Finland, women who were exposed to interferon beta during pregnancy did not report \\nsignificant changes in the birth weight, height, or head circumference of their infants.12\\nConsiderations in Children\\nThere are insufficient data on the use of interferons to treat respiratory viral infections in children to \\nmake any recommendations for treating children with COVID-19.\\nReferences\\n1.

A total of 9,450 patients did not receive supplemental oxygen \\nduring the study. Of these patients, 3,514 (37%) received dexamethasone for a median duration of 5 days \\n(IQR 3–8 days). Using average treatment effect estimates, patients who received dexamethasone without \\nsupplemental oxygen had an increased risk of death within 90 days (HR 1.76; 95% CI, 1.47–2.12). \\nPatients who received dexamethasone either without supplemental oxygen or with low-flow nasal \\ncannula oxygen had a 60% higher risk of death. Although this study was observational, the investigators \\nemployed several statistical techniques to minimize potential bias, including propensity scoring and \\nweighted analyses. Additionally, several subgroup and sensitivity analyses in this study confirmed the \\noverall results.\\nDexamethasone Dose\\nThe RECOVERY platform trial studied the use of dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for up to 10 \\ndays,3 which is currently the recommended dose for hospitalized adults with COVID-19 who require \\nsupplemental oxygen. Several other randomized controlled trials evaluated the role of higher doses \\nof dexamethasone or other corticosteroids in hospitalized patients with different levels of respiratory \\nsupport. The results of some key studies are summarized below.\\nPatients Who Received Conventional Oxygen or No Supplemental Oxygen\\nThe RECOVERY platform trial included an additional study in which patients with COVID-19 and \\nevidence of hypoxemia (i.e., they were receiving conventional supplemental oxygen or had an oxygen \\nsaturation <92% on room air) were randomized to receive usual care plus high-dose dexamethasone \\n(20 mg once daily for 5 days, then 10 mg once daily for 5 days or until hospital discharge, whichever \\ncame first) or usual care alone, which included low-dose dexamethasone (usually 6 mg once daily for 10 \\ndays).5 On May 11, 2022, the trial’s independent data monitoring committee stopped enrolling patients \\nreceiving conventional oxygen therapy and those not receiving any supplemental oxygen. Among the \\n1,272 patients enrolled, 28-day mortality was higher in the high-dose dexamethasone arm than in the \\nusual care arm (19% vs. 12%; rate ratio 1.59; 95% CI, 1.20–2.10; P = 0.0012). \\nPatients Who Received Noninvasive or Mechanical Ventilation\\nThe COVID STEROID 2 trial investigated the use of different doses of corticosteroids in patients \\nwith COVID-19 and severe hypoxemia.6 In this multicenter trial, hospitalized patients who required \\nat least 10 L/min of oxygen or mechanical ventilation were randomized to receive up to 10 days \\nof dexamethasone 6 mg once daily (n = 485) or dexamethasone 12 mg once daily (n = 497). The \\nmedian number of days alive without life support at 28 days after randomization was 20.5 days in the \\ndexamethasone 6 mg arm and 22.0 days in the dexamethasone 12 mg arm, yielding an adjusted mean \\ndifference of 1.3 days (95% CI, 0–2.6; P = 0.07). No differences between the arms were found for 28- \\nor 90-day mortality.

However, the Panel notes that \\nboth the conventional and Bayesian analyses conducted during the COVID STEROID 2 trial suggest \\nthat a dose of 12 mg might confer a benefit in patients who require NIV or mechanical ventilation.6,7 \\nMost patients in the COVID STEROID 2 trial did not receive additional immunomodulators beyond \\ncorticosteroids.6 Currently, there are no data from clinical trials that evaluated the safety and efficacy \\nof using doses of dexamethasone that were larger or smaller than 6 mg once daily in combination with \\nother immunomodulators to treat hospitalized adults with COVID-19. \\nCombination Immunomodulator Therapy\\nUsing systemic corticosteroids in combination with other agents, including tocilizumab (see \\nInterleukin-6 Inhibitors),9,10 baricitinib (see Janus Kinase Inhibitors),11 abatacept, or infliximab,12 has \\nbeen shown to have a clinical benefit in subsets of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially \\nthose who are in the early stages of critical illness and those with signs of systemic inflammation. For \\nthe Panel’s recommendations on when to use dexamethasone with another immunomodulator, see \\nTherapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19.\\nSee Table 5a for a summary of the data from clinical trials that have evaluated the use of systemic \\ncorticosteroids in patients with COVID-19. \\nSystemic Corticosteroids Other Than Dexamethasone\\nSystemic corticosteroids other than dexamethasone, including hydrocortisone13,14 and \\nmethylprednisolone,15,16 have been studied for the treatment of COVID-19 in several randomized trials. \\nSome of these trials were stopped early due to low enrollment following the release of the RECOVERY \\ntrial results. Consequently, the sample size of these trials was insufficient to assess efficacy (i.e., \\nthere were too few events to definitively confirm or exclude an effect, although many point estimates \\nsuggested a beneficial effect). Therefore, the evidence supporting the use of hydrocortisone or \\nmethylprednisolone for the treatment of COVID-19 is not as strong as the evidence supporting the use of \\ndexamethasone. Based on the available evidence, the Panel has concluded the following:\\n• If dexamethasone is not available, alternative corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, \\nmethylprednisolone, hydrocortisone) can be used (BIII). \\n• For these drugs, the total daily dose equivalencies to dexamethasone 6 mg (orally or \\nintravenously)17 are: \\n• Prednisone 40 mg\\n• Methylprednisolone 32 mg\\n• Hydrocortisone 160 mg\\n• Half-life, duration of action, and frequency of administration vary among corticosteroids.\\n• Long-acting corticosteroid: Dexamethasone; half-life 36 to 72 hours; administer once daily.\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Unlike other corticosteroids that have \\npreviously been studied in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, dexamethasone lacks \\nmineralocorticoid activity and, thus, its effects on sodium balance and fluid volume are minimal.18\\nMonitoring, Adverse Effects, and Drug-Drug Interactions\\nClinicians should closely monitor patients with COVID-19 who are receiving dexamethasone for certain \\nadverse effects (e.g., hyperglycemia, secondary infections, psychiatric effects, avascular necrosis). \\nThe use of systemic corticosteroids may increase the risk of opportunistic fungal infections (e.g., \\naspergillosis, mucormycosis) and reactivation of latent infections (e.g., hepatitis B virus infection,  \\nherpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus infections, strongyloidiasis, tuberculosis).19-26 Cases \\nof severe and disseminated strongyloidiasis have been reported in patients with COVID-19 during \\ntreatment with tocilizumab and corticosteroids.24,27 Many clinicians would initiate empiric treatment \\nfor strongyloidiasis (e.g., with the antiparasitic drug ivermectin), with or without serologic testing, in \\npatients who currently reside or who have previously resided in areas where Strongyloides is endemic \\n(i.e., tropical, subtropical, or warm temperate areas).28 \\nUsing systemic corticosteroids with other immunosuppressants, such as tocilizumab or baricitinib, \\ncould theoretically increase the risk of secondary infections. However, clinical trials have reported \\nno difference in the rates of secondary infections between patients who received corticosteroids \\nin combination with another immunomodulatory agent and those who received corticosteroids \\nalone. Dexamethasone is a moderate cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer. Therefore, it could reduce the \\nconcentration and potential efficacy of concomitant medications that are cytochrome P450 3A4 \\nsubstrates. Clinicians should carefully review a patient’s concomitant medications to assess the potential \\nfor drug-drug interactions.\\nConsiderations in Pregnant and Lactating People\\nSee Pregnancy, Lactation, and COVID-19 Therapeutics for the Panel’s guidance regarding the use of \\ndexamethasone during pregnancy and lactation. \\nConsiderations in Children\\nDexamethasone is recommended for hospitalized children with COVID-19 who require supplemental \\noxygen. See Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Children With COVID-19 for the Panel’s \\nrecommendations. Methylprednisolone or another corticosteroid is recommended for the treatment of \\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). See Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized \\nChildren With MIS-C, Plus a Discussion on MIS-A for the Panel’s recommendations.\\nReferences\\n1.

In addition, certain inhaled corticosteroids have \\nbeen shown to impair viral replication of SARS-CoV-21 and downregulate the expression of the \\nreceptors used for cell entry.2,3 Several trials provide additional insights regarding the role of inhaled \\ncorticosteroids in treating outpatients with COVID-19. These trials are described below and in Table 5b. \\nRecommendations\\n• There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) to \\nrecommend either for or against the use of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19.\\n• There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of \\nthe combination of inhaled budesonide plus fluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19 in \\nnonhospitalized patients.\\n• Patients with COVID-19 who are receiving an inhaled corticosteroid for an underlying condition \\nshould continue this therapy as directed by their health care provider (AIII).\\nRationale\\nCompared to usual care, inhaled corticosteroid therapy decreased the time to recovery in 2 open-label \\nrandomized controlled trials in outpatients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.4,5 However, subsequent \\nplacebo-controlled, double-blind trials have shown that corticosteroid therapy did not reduce the \\nduration of COVID-19 symptoms.6-8 The available evidence does not show that inhaled corticosteroid \\ntherapy reduces the risk of hospitalization or death due to COVID-19. However, the Panel acknowledges \\nthat there are areas of uncertainty. Studies conducted predominantly among unvaccinated patients have \\nreported mixed results. \\nACTIV-6 is the only randomized controlled trial of inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy that was \\nconducted in a predominantly vaccinated population.8 In this study, treatment with inhaled fluticasone \\ndid not reduce the number of hospitalizations or health care visits or the time to sustained recovery. \\nHowever, this study included patients who were at modest risk for complications from COVID-19. The \\nmedian age of the patients was 45 years, and patients were not required to have a comorbidity to be \\nincluded in the study. \\nThe mixed results from these studies make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the benefit \\nof using inhaled corticosteroids in people who are at high risk of disease progression. See Therapeutic \\nManagement of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for recommendations regarding therapies for \\nhigh-risk outpatients. \\nThe combination of inhaled budesonide plus oral fluvoxamine was studied in a large, double-blind, \\nplacebo-controlled, adaptive randomized trial in Brazil.9 Over 90% of the patients had received at least \\n2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Treatment with this combination significantly reduced the incidence of \\nthe primary outcome, which was a composite of hospitalization or retention in an emergency setting for \\n>6 hours. The proportion of patients who were hospitalized was the same in the treatment and placebo \\narms (0.9% vs. 1.1%), and the treatment did not significantly impact secondary outcomes such as health \\ncare attendance or the need for an emergency setting visit.

Infection by SARS-CoV induces a dose-dependent \\nproduction of IL-6 from bronchial epithelial cells.1 COVID-19–associated systemic inflammation \\nand hypoxemic respiratory failure can be associated with heightened cytokine release, as indicated by \\nelevated levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and ferritin in the blood.2-4 \\nThe recombinant humanized anti–IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) tocilizumab \\nand sarilumab have been evaluated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who had systemic \\ninflammation. Tocilizumab is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients \\nwith rheumatologic disorders and in patients with cytokine release syndrome induced by chimeric \\nantigen receptor T cell therapy. On December 21, 2022, the FDA approved the use of intravenous \\n(IV) tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults who are receiving systemic \\ncorticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilation (NIV), mechanical ventilation, \\nor extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).5,6 Tocilizumab can be administered as an IV infusion \\nor a subcutaneous (SUBQ) injection; however, only the IV formulation of tocilizumab should be used \\nfor the treatment of COVID-19. \\nSarilumab is approved by the FDA for use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It is available as a \\nSUBQ formulation and is not approved for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome or COVID-19.\\nRecommendations\\n• See Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for the COVID-19 \\nTreatment Guidelines Panel’s (the Panel) recommendations on the use of tocilizumab in \\ncombination with dexamethasone in hospitalized patients who require conventional oxygen, \\nhigh-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen, NIV , or mechanical ventilation.\\nAdditional Considerations\\n• If none of the recommended immunomodulatory therapies discussed in Therapeutic Management \\nof Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 are available or feasible to use, IV sarilumab can be used \\nin combination with dexamethasone (CIIa).

In the \\nREMAP-CAP trial, a long-term follow-up through 180 days confirmed that treatment with an anti–IL-6 \\nreceptor mAb improved survival among patients with severe to critical COVID-19.12 However, the Panel \\nfound it challenging to determine which patients with COVID-19 who are receiving low-flow oxygen \\nwould benefit from receiving tocilizumab or sarilumab plus dexamethasone.\\nIf none of the recommended immunomodulatory therapies are available or feasible to use, sarilumab \\nmay be used because the REMAP-CAP trial demonstrated that the use of tocilizumab and the use of \\nsarilumab improved survival and reduced the duration of organ support.12,13 Sarilumab is currently only \\napproved for use in the United States as a SUBQ injection.\\nMonitoring and Adverse Effects\\nThe primary laboratory abnormalities reported in people receiving tocilizumab and sarilumab are \\nelevated liver enzyme levels that appear to be dose dependent and rare occurrences of neutropenia or \\nthrombocytopenia.5,14 In randomized trials, no excess secondary infections were seen among patients \\nwho received tocilizumab plus corticosteroids when compared with control patients.15-17 Additional \\nadverse effects of tocilizumab, such as serious infections (e.g., tuberculosis, bacterial or fungal \\ninfections) and bowel perforation, have been reported.

See Table 5e for additional details.\\nClinical Data\\nTwo large randomized controlled trials, REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY , evaluated the use of \\ntocilizumab in combination with standard of care corticosteroids.7,8 Both studies reported a statistically \\nsignificant survival benefit from the use of tocilizumab in certain patients, including patients who \\nexhibited rapid respiratory decompensation associated with an inflammatory response. \\nREMAP-CAP enrolled critically ill patients who were within 24 hours of receiving respiratory support \\nin an intensive care unit.7 At baseline, 29% of these patients were receiving HFNC oxygen, 42% were \\nreceiving NIV , and 29% were receiving mechanical ventilation. The patients were randomized to receive \\nopen-label tocilizumab or usual care. In-hospital mortality was 28% in the tocilizumab arm and 36% in \\nthe usual care arm. A follow-up analysis confirmed these findings.12 At 180 days, mortality was 36% in \\nthe tocilizumab arm and 40% in the usual care arm. \\nThe RECOVERY trial enrolled hospitalized patients with COVID-19 into an open-label platform \\ntrial that included several treatment options.8 A subset of all trial participants who had hypoxemia and \\nCRP levels ≥75 mg/L were offered enrollment into a second randomization that compared the use of \\ntocilizumab to usual care. In this subgroup, the 28-day mortality was 31% in the tocilizumab arm and \\n35% in the usual care arm. \\nIn contrast to the REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY trials, other randomized trials, including the \\nREMDACTA and EMPACTA trials, found that tocilizumab did not reduce all-cause mortality.18,19 In \\nthose trials, >80% of participants received corticosteroids as part of standard care, and most participants \\nin the REMDACTA trial required NIV or HFNC oxygen.18\\nIn the REMAP-CAP trial, the efficacy results for sarilumab were similar to those for tocilizumab.13 \\nWhen compared with patients in the standard of care arm (n = 406), patients in the sarilumab arm \\n(n = 485) had more organ support-free days (OR 1.50; 95% CrI, 1.13–2.00) and a greater likelihood \\nof survival while hospitalized (OR 1.51; 95% CrI, 1.06–2.20). In-hospital mortality was 33% for \\nthe sarilumab arm and 37% for the standard of care arm, and mortality at 180 days was 33% for the \\nsarilumab arm and 40% for the standard of care arm.12 A notable limitation to the sarilumab findings in \\nthe REMAP-CAP trial is that patients in the standard of care arm were enrolled earlier in the pandemic \\nthan those in the sarilumab arm.13 Randomization closed in November 2020 for the standard of care arm \\nand continued through April 2021 for the sarilumab arm. \\nAn adaptive, multinational, double-blind, randomized (2:2:1) trial compared the efficacy and safety of \\nsarilumab 400 mg IV and sarilumab 200 mg IV to placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.20 \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

JAK inhibitors are used to treat COVID-19 because they can prevent phosphorylation of \\nkey proteins involved in the signal transduction that leads to immune activation and inflammation (e.g., \\nthe cellular response to proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin [IL]-6).3 Several JAK inhibitors \\nare available for clinical use, but only baricitinib and tofacitinib have been studied for the treatment of \\nCOVID-19.\\nIn May 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of baricitinib for the treatment \\nof COVID-19 in hospitalized adults who require supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilation (NIV), \\nmechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.4 Baricitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor \\nthat is selective for JAK1 and JAK2. It can modulate downstream inflammatory responses via JAK1/\\nJAK2 inhibition and has exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of IL-6–induced STAT3 phosphorylation.5\\nTofacitinib is a JAK inhibitor that is predominantly selective for JAK1 and JAK3. However, it also has \\nmodest activity against JAK2; thus, it can block signaling from gamma-chain cytokines (e.g., IL-2, \\nIL-4) and glycoprotein 130 proteins (e.g., IL-6, IL-11, interferons). It is an oral agent that was first \\napproved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and has been shown to decrease levels of \\nIL-6 in patients with this disease.6 Tofacitinib is also approved by the FDA for the treatment of psoriatic \\narthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis.7 \\nRecommendation\\n• See Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for the COVID-19 \\nTreatment Guidelines Panel’s (the Panel) recommendations on the use of baricitinib in \\ncombination with dexamethasone in hospitalized patients who require conventional oxygen, \\nhigh-flow nasal cannula oxygen, NIV , or mechanical ventilation.\\nAdditional Consideration\\n• If none of the recommended immunomodulatory therapies discussed in Therapeutic Management \\nof Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 are available or feasible to use, oral tofacitinib can be \\nused in combination with dexamethasone (CIIa).  \\nRationale\\nSeveral large randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that some patients who require \\nsupplemental oxygen and most patients who require oxygen through a high-flow device, NIV , or \\nmechanical ventilation benefit from the use of dexamethasone in combination with a JAK inhibitor. \\nIn the RECOVERY trial, baricitinib was associated with a survival benefit among hospitalized patients, \\nwith a treatment effect that was most pronounced among patients who were receiving NIV or oxygen \\nsupplementation through a high-flow device.8 The COV-BARRIER trial also demonstrated a survival \\nbenefit for baricitinib that was most pronounced among patients who were receiving high-flow oxygen \\nor NIV .9 In the addendum to the COV-BARRIER trial, the benefit extended to patients who were \\nreceiving mechanical ventilation.10 Data from the ACTT-211 and ACTT-412 trials support the overall \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

If none of the other recommended immunomodulatory \\ntherapies for the treatment of COVID-19 are available or feasible to use, tofacitinib may be used as a \\nsubstitute based on the findings from the STOP-COVID study.\\nThe clinical trial data on the use of baricitinib and tofacitinib in patients with COVID-19 are \\nsummarized in Table 5d. \\nMonitoring, Adverse Effects, and Drug-Drug Interactions\\nThe FDA reviewed the data from a large, randomized, safety clinical trial that compared the use of \\ntofacitinib to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in people with rheumatoid arthritis over 4 years.14 The \\nFDA review reported that the use of tofacitinib was associated with a higher incidence of serious adverse \\nevents, including heart attack, stroke, cancer, blood clots, and death. Therefore, the FDA now requires \\nnew and updated warnings for drugs in the JAK inhibitor class, including baricitinib and tofacitinib. The \\ndata from randomized trials that have evaluated the safety of short-term use of JAK inhibitors in patients \\nwith COVID-19 have not revealed significant safety signals, such as thrombosis.8,9,11-13 Because JAK \\ninhibitors have immunosuppressive effects, all patients who are receiving either baricitinib or tofacitinib \\nshould be monitored for new infections. \\nNo clinically significant drug-drug interactions are expected between baricitinib and concomitant drugs. \\nTofacitinib is a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 substrate. Dose modifications are required when the drug \\nis coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, or when it is used with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor \\nthat is coadministered with a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor. Coadministering tofacitinib with a strong \\nCYP3A4 inducer is not recommended. See Table 5e for JAK inhibitor drug characteristics and dosing \\ninformation.\\nConsiderations in Pregnant and Lactating People\\nSee Pregnancy, Lactation, and COVID-19 Therapeutics for the Panel’s guidance regarding the use \\nof baricitinib during pregnancy and lactation. Pregnancy registries provide some outcome data on \\ntofacitinib use during pregnancy for other conditions (e.g., ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, \\npsoriasis). Among the cases reported, pregnancy outcomes were similar to those among the general \\npopulation.15-17\\nConsiderations in Children\\nSee Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Children With COVID-19 for the Panel’s \\nrecommendations regarding the use of baricitinib or tofacitinib in children with COVID-19.\\nReferences\\n1.

All arms received standard care, and the separate \\nanalyses included data from a shared placebo arm. One substudy compared the use of a single dose of \\nintravenous abatacept 10 mg/kg to placebo. The primary endpoint was time to recovery by Day 28. Key \\nsecondary endpoints included clinical status at Day 14 and mortality through Days 28 and 60.\\nThe study concluded that use of abatacept in patients with COVID-19 did not have a significant effect on the \\ntime to recovery. A reduction in 28-day mortality, a secondary endpoint, was found. Patients who required \\nmechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation did not benefit from the use of abatacept.\\nMonitoring and Adverse Effects\\nConcomitant use of abatacept and other immunomodulatory agents may increase the risk of serious \\ninfections. Due to its immunosuppressive effects, all patients who are receiving abatacept should also be \\nmonitored for new infections. In the ACTIV-1 trial, the use of a single dose of abatacept in patients with \\nCOVID-19 did not reveal significant safety concerns.\\nMost of the data on the adverse effects of abatacept come from the chronic use of the agent for the \\ntreatment of autoimmune diseases and graft-versus-host disease. When abatacept is used for the \\nprevention of acute graft-versus-host disease, the most commonly reported adverse effects include \\nfever, anemia, hypertension, cytomegalovirus infection (or reactivation), pneumonia, epistaxis, CD4 \\nlymphopenia, and acute kidney injury.5 \\nConsiderations in Pregnant and Lactating People\\nSee Pregnancy, Lactation, and COVID-19 Therapeutics for the Panel’s guidance regarding the use of \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Drugs that block the IL-1 receptor (e.g., anakinra) or \\ndrugs that block IL-1 signaling (e.g., canakinumab) can potentially interrupt this autoinflammatory loop. \\nThese drugs have been investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19.\\nAnakinra is a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist. It is approved by the Food and Drug \\nAdministration (FDA) to treat rheumatoid arthritis and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, \\nspecifically neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease.4 It is used off-label to treat severe \\nchimeric antigen receptor T cell-mediated cytokine release syndrome and macrophage activation \\nsyndrome/secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. On November 8, 2022, the FDA issued \\nan Emergency Use Authorization for anakinra. The Emergency Use Authorization allows the use of \\nanakinra to treat COVID-19 in certain hospitalized adults with pneumonia.

In addition, among patients who received anakinra, no reduction \\nin mortality was observed during a 180-day follow up.8 Several smaller trials that evaluated the use of \\nanakinra in people with COVID-19 were either stopped early due to futility or did not detect a benefit \\nof anakinra in these patients.9-11 Meta-analyses of the available data have not detected a benefit of using \\nanakinra to treat COVID-19.12,13\\nThe SA VE-MORE study population was restricted to participants with high levels of suPAR (≥6 ng/\\nmL) based on the hypothesis that this group is most likely to benefit from IL-1 inhibition.

Patients were randomized \\n2:1 to receive anakinra 100 mg subcutaneously once daily for 10 days or placebo. The primary endpoint \\nwas clinical status at Day 28 on the 11-point World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale \\n(WHO-CPS). Additional analyses assessed outcomes at Days 60 and 90.33\\nResults\\n• Patients who were randomized to receive anakinra had lower odds of a worse WHO-CPS score at \\nDay 28 (OR 0.36; 95% CI, 0.26–0.50; P < 0.0001). \\n• The secondary endpoints also favored anakinra, including the absolute decrease in WHO-CPS \\nscores from baseline at Days 14 and 28, the absolute decrease in sequential organ failure \\nassessment (SOFA) scores from baseline at Day 7, the median time to hospital discharge, and the \\nmedian duration of ICU stays.\\n• A smaller proportion of patients in the anakinra arm experienced secondary infections, including \\nventilator-associated pneumonias, than in the placebo arm (8.4% vs. 15.9%; P = 0.01).\\n• Twenty-eight–day mortality was lower among patients who received anakinra than among those \\nwho received placebo (3.2% vs. 6.9%; HR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21–0.98; P = 0.045). \\n• Additional analyses performed at Days 60 and 90 showed a sustained survival benefit for \\nanakinra.\\nLimitations\\nThe laboratory assay that is used to assess suPAR levels is not currently available in many countries, \\nincluding the United States.

High concentrations of C5a have been reported \\nin patients with severe COVID-19.1 C5a activates innate immune system responses, including \\ninflammation and the release of histamines, and can increase damage to local tissues.2 A study in mice \\ndemonstrated that an anti-C5a monoclonal antibody reduced immune system activation and inhibited \\nlung injury.3 Vilobelimab targets C5a, which is a product of complement activation, and preserves \\nmembrane attack complex function.4 Vilobelimab is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration \\n(FDA) for any indication.\\nOn April 4, 2023, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for the use of vilobelimab for the \\ntreatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when it is administered within 48 hours of mechanical \\nventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.5 \\nRecommendation\\n• There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) to \\nrecommend either for or against the use of vilobelimab for the treatment of COVID-19.\\nRationale\\nResults from the PANAMO trial were used to support the FDA Emergency Use Authorization.5 \\nHowever, the prespecified analysis that stratified by study site showed that 28-day mortality among \\npatients with COVID-19 who received vilobelimab was not significantly different from 28-day mortality \\namong those who received placebo. The initially proposed primary study analysis did not stratify \\nby study site. In the second phase of the study, the primary analysis was changed to stratify by site \\nbased on a recommendation from the FDA. The analysis that did not stratify by site demonstrated that \\nall-cause mortality through Day 28 was significantly lower in the vilobelimab arm than in the placebo \\narm. Concomitant use of corticosteroids (97%) and antithrombotic agents (98%) was high in this study \\npopulation. Prior or concomitant use of additional immunomodulators, such as tocilizumab (17% in \\nthe vilobelimab arm, 16% in the placebo arm) and baricitinib (3% in each arm), was low. The Panel \\ndetermined that the results from the PANAMO trial were insufficient to recommend either for or against \\nthe use of vilobelimab for the treatment of COVID-19. \\nMonitoring, Adverse Effects, and Drug-Drug Interactions\\nReports of adverse effects of vilobelimab are limited to a Phase 3 trial that included critically ill adult \\npatients with COVID-19 who received intravenous vilobelimab 800 mg for up to 6 doses.5,6 Common \\nadverse reactions (i.e., those with an incidence ≥3% and that were observed at least 1% more frequently \\nin the vilobelimab arm than in the placebo arm through Day 60) were pneumonia, sepsis, delirium, \\npulmonary embolism, hypertension, pneumothorax, deep vein thrombosis, herpes simplex, enterococcal \\ninfection, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, increased hepatic enzymes, urinary tract infection, \\nhypoxemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumomediastinum, respiratory tract infection, supraventricular \\ntachycardia, constipation, and rash. \\nVilobelimab is not expected to be associated with any pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. \\nConsiderations in Pregnant People\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

It may be necessary to modify the dosage of the antithrombotic agent, switch to another antithrombotic \\nagent, or prescribe an alternative COVID-19 therapy. See Drug-Drug Interactions Between Ritonavir-Boosted \\nNirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and Concomitant Medications for more information.\\nScreening and Evaluation for Venous Thromboembolism\\n • There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against routine screening for venous \\nthromboembolism (VTE) in patients with COVID-19 who do not have signs or symptoms of VTE, regardless of the status \\nof their coagulation markers.\\n • For hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who experience rapid deterioration of pulmonary, cardiac, or neurological \\nfunction or sudden, localized loss of peripheral perfusion, the Panel recommends evaluating the patients for \\nthromboembolic disease (AIII). \\nAntithrombotic Therapy for Nonhospitalized Adults Without Evidence of Venous Thromboembolism\\n • In nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19, the Panel recommends against the use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet \\ntherapy (i.e., aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors) for the prevention of VTE or arterial thrombosis, except in a clinical trial (AIIa). \\nThis recommendation does not apply to patients with other indications for antithrombotic therapy.\\nAntithrombotic Therapy for Hospitalized, Nonpregnant Adults Without Evidence of Venous Thromboembolism\\n • The Panel recommends against using anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy to prevent arterial thrombosis outside of \\nthe usual standard of care for patients without COVID-19 (AIII).\\n • In hospitalized patients, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) is preferred over \\noral anticoagulants (AIII). Because these types of heparin have shorter half-lives, their effects can be reversed quickly. \\nThey can also be administered intravenously or subcutaneously, and they have fewer drug-drug interactions than oral \\nanticoagulants.\\n • When heparin is used, LMWH is preferred over UFH.\\nFor adults who require low-flow oxygen and do not require intensive care unit (ICU)-level care:\\n • The Panel recommends the use of a therapeutic dose of heparin for patients with D-dimer levels above the upper \\nlimit of normal who require low-flow oxygen and who do not have an increased risk of bleeding (CIIa).\\n • Contraindications for the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 include a platelet count \\n<50,000 cells/µL, hemoglobin <8 g/dL, the need for dual antiplatelet therapy, bleeding within the past 30 days \\nthat required an emergency department visit or hospitalization, a history of a bleeding disorder, or an inherited or \\nactive acquired bleeding disorder.

Clinicians should consider an individual patient's VTE risk factors when making decisions \\nabout continuing VTE prophylaxis after discharge in pregnant or postpartum patients.\\n • The use of anticoagulant therapy during labor and delivery requires specialized care and planning. The management \\nof anticoagulant therapy in pregnant patients with COVID-19 should be similar to the management used for pregnant \\npatients with other conditions (AIII).\\n • UFH, LMWH, and warfarin do not accumulate in breast milk and do not induce an anticoagulant effect in the newborn; \\ntherefore, they can be used by breastfeeding individuals who require VTE prophylaxis or treatment (AIII). \\nChildren With COVID-19 or MIS-C\\n • For the Panel’s recommendations on the use of antithrombotic therapy in children, see Therapeutic Management \\nof Hospitalized Children With COVID-19 and Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Children With MIS-C, Plus a \\nDiscussion on MIS-A.\\nEach recommendation in the Guidelines receives a rating for the strength of the recommendation (A, B, or C) and a rating \\nfor the evidence that supports it (I, IIa, IIb, or III).

In randomized controlled trials conducted prior to the pandemic, the \\nincidence of VTE in hospitalized patients who received VTE prophylaxis ranged from 0.3% to 1% for \\nsymptomatic VTE and from 2.8% to 5.6% for VTE overall.6-8 In randomized trials, the VTE incidence \\namong critically ill patients without COVID-19 who received a prophylactic dose of anticoagulants \\nranged from 5% to 16%, and a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients with sepsis reported a \\nVTE incidence of 37%.9-12 \\nGuidelines for the use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with COVID-19 have been released by \\nmultiple organizations, including the American College of Chest Physicians,13 the American Society of \\nHematology,14 the Anticoagulation Forum,15 the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis,16 \\nthe Italian Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis,17 the National Institute for Health and Care \\nExcellence,18 and the Royal College of Physicians.19 The American College of Chest Physicians also has \\nguidance on the use of antithrombotic therapy to treat arterial thrombosis in people with COVID-19.20 \\nThe guidelines referenced above agree that hospitalized, nonpregnant patients with COVID-19 should \\nreceive, at a minimum, a prophylactic dose of anticoagulation to prevent VTE. The National Institute \\nfor Health and Care Excellence guidelines state: “Consider a treatment dose of a low-molecular-weight \\nheparin (LMWH) for young people and adults with COVID-19 who need low-flow oxygen and who do \\nnot have an increased bleeding risk.” Results from clinical trials have provided further information on \\nthe safety and efficacy of different antithrombotic strategies for patients with COVID-19.\\nChronic Anticoagulant or Antiplatelet Therapy\\nThe COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends that patients with COVID-19 who \\nare receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapies for underlying conditions continue these medications \\nunless significant bleeding develops or other contraindications are present (AIII). Outpatients with \\nCOVID-19 who are receiving warfarin and are in isolation and unable to have international normalized \\nratio monitoring may be candidates for switching to direct oral anticoagulant therapy.21 Patients with \\na mechanical heart valve, a ventricular assist device, valvular atrial fibrillation, or antiphospholipid \\nantibody syndrome and patients who are lactating should not discontinue treatment with warfarin (AIII). \\nBefore prescribing ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) to patients who are receiving anticoagulant \\nor antiplatelet therapy, clinicians should carefully review the patient’s concomitant medications to \\nevaluate potential drug-drug interactions. It may be necessary to modify the dosage of the antithrombotic \\nagent, switch to another antithrombotic agent, or prescribe an alternative COVID-19 therapy.

The Liverpool COVID-19 Drug Interactions website \\nprovides a list of drug-drug interactions. In hospitalized patients, LMWH or unfractionated heparin \\n(UFH) is preferred over oral anticoagulants (AIII). Because these types of heparin have shorter \\nhalf-lives, their effects can be reversed quickly. They can also be administered intravenously or \\nsubcutaneously (SUBQ), and they have fewer drug-drug interactions than oral anticoagulants.\\nManagement of Nonhospitalized Adults\\nACTIV-4b was a placebo-controlled, randomized trial that evaluated the efficacy of using aspirin or \\nprophylactic doses (2.5 mg) or therapeutic doses (5 mg) of apixaban in outpatients with COVID-19 \\naged >40 years.23 After 657 outpatients were randomized, the trial was stopped in June 2021 due to a \\nlow event rate for the composite outcome of thromboembolic events, hospitalization, or death (1 patient \\neach in the placebo, aspirin, and apixaban 2.5 mg arms and 2 patients in the apixaban 5 mg arm). The \\nmedian time from randomization to receipt of treatment was 3 days, and 22 patients were hospitalized \\nfor COVID-19 prior to initiation of the study drugs. \\nTwo trials evaluated the use of LMWH and its impact on hospitalization and mortality in outpatients \\nwith COVID-19. The ETHIC trial was a multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial of \\nunvaccinated outpatients with COVID-19.24 Adults with at least 1 risk factor for severe disease were \\nrandomized to receive enoxaparin 40 mg SUBQ once daily (if they weighed <100 kg) or enoxaparin \\n40 mg SUBQ twice daily (if they weighed >100 kg) for 21 days or standard of care. The study was \\nterminated early due to a low event rate and slow accrual of participants. There was no difference \\nbetween the arms in the number of patients who met the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality \\nor all-cause hospitalization (12 of 105 patients [11%] in the enoxaparin arm vs. 12 of 114 patients \\n[11%] in the standard of care arm). Four of the 12 patients in the enoxaparin arm who were admitted \\nto the hospital required acute medical care or intensive care unit (ICU) admission (3 patients \\nrequired mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]). There were no \\nhospitalizations in the standard of care arm. Bleeding events occurred in 2 patients who received \\nenoxaparin and in 1 patient who received standard of care. \\nThe OVID trial was a multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial of 472 outpatients with \\nCOVID-19 aged >50 years who were randomized to receive enoxaparin 40 mg SUBQ once daily for \\n14 days or standard of care.25 The study was terminated after recruiting 50% of the planned number \\nof participants due to a low probability that enoxaparin would be superior to standard of care for the \\nprimary outcome.

Observational studies and clinical trials have examined the \\neffects of anticoagulation on mortality, progression of COVID-19, thrombosis, and bleeding. Some \\nof these studies are outlined below. Observational studies are included here only when evidence from \\nclinical trials is not available. The clinical data for these trials are summarized in Table 6a. \\nProphylactic Dose of Anticoagulation Versus No Anticoagulation\\nAn observational study of 4,297 veterans hospitalized with COVID-19 evaluated the use of prophylactic \\nanticoagulation.26 A prophylactic dose of anticoagulation was administered to 3,627 patients with \\nCOVID-19 within 24 hours of hospital admission. An inverse probability of treatment weighted \\nanalysis showed a cumulative 30-day mortality of 14% among patients who received prophylactic \\nanticoagulation and 19% among patients who were not treated with anticoagulation (HR 0.73; 95% \\nCI, 0.66–0.81). Patients treated with the prophylactic dose did not have a significant difference in the \\nrisk of bleeding that required transfusion when compared with patients who were not treated with \\nanticoagulation (HR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71–1.05). Overall, the study demonstrated that patients with \\nCOVID-19 may benefit from a prophylactic dose of anticoagulation.\\nTherapeutic Versus Prophylactic Doses of Heparin in Hospitalized Patients Who Do Not \\nRequire Intensive Care Unit-Level Care\\nFour open-label randomized controlled trials (the large ATTACC/ACTIV-4a/REMAP-CAP \\nmultiplatform trial and the FREEDOM trial, and the smaller RAPID and HEP-COVID trials) compared \\ntherapeutic doses of heparin to prophylactic or intermediate doses of the anticoagulant in selected \\nhospitalized patients who did not require intensive care. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for \\nthese studies varied, but most of the studies included patients who required supplemental oxygen and \\nhad no risk of a major bleeding event. In the larger multiplatform trial, therapeutic doses of heparin \\nincreased the number of organ support-free days but did not significantly affect mortality or length \\nof hospitalization when compared with prophylactic doses of heparin.27 In the FREEDOM trial, there \\nwas no difference between the therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation arms in the occurrence \\nof the 30-day primary composite outcome of all-cause mortality, need for ICU-level care, systemic \\nthromboembolism, or ischemic stroke. In a secondary analysis, 30-day mortality was significantly lower \\nin patients who received therapeutic enoxaparin than in patients who received prophylactic enoxaparin.28 \\nHowever, only a small proportion of patients received concomitant corticosteroids or remdesivir as \\nstandard of care, and the trial was stopped early due to slow recruitment. \\nThe RAPID trial enrolled patients with elevated D-dimer levels and hypoxemia.29 The patients were \\nrandomized to receive therapeutic or prophylactic doses of heparin. There was no statistically significant \\ndifference between the arms for the primary endpoint, which was a composite of ICU admission, \\nnoninvasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation, or death by Day 28.

The pooled antiplatelet arm had \\nimproved survival by 90 days (median aHR 1.22; 95% CrI, 1.06–1.40). The use of antiplatelet therapy \\nwas associated with an increased incidence of major bleeding (2.1% in the pooled antiplatelet arm vs. \\n0.4% in the control arm; aOR 2.97; 95% CrI, 1.23–8.28; adjusted absolute risk difference of 0.8%; 95% \\nCrI, 0.1% to 2.7%). \\nIn the RECOVERY trial, the use of aspirin therapy was not associated with a reduction in mortality \\nat 28 days in the subgroups of patients who required NIV or mechanical ventilation at baseline. In \\nthe REMAP-CAP trial, administering antiplatelet therapy to critically ill patients with COVID-19 \\nimproved 90-day survival but did not increase the number of organ support-free days. In both studies, \\nthe use of antiplatelet therapy was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. The COVID-PACT \\ntrial randomized 292 adult patients with COVID-19 who required ICU-level care to receive either \\nclopidogrel or no antiplatelet therapy.33 There was no difference between the arms in the incidence of \\nVTE, arterial thrombotic events, or bleeding. \\nGiven the inconsistent results of these trials, there is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend \\neither for or against the use of antiplatelet therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Eligible \\npatients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials that are evaluating the use of antiplatelet \\ntherapy. \\nThe clinical data for the trials discussed above are summarized in Table 6b.\\nPatients Discharged From the Hospital\\nFor patients with a high risk of VTE who do not have COVID-19, post-discharge prophylaxis has been \\nshown to be beneficial.

Five patients (3%) who were treated with \\nrivaroxaban and 15 patients (9%) who did not receive anticoagulation experienced a thrombotic event \\n(relative risk 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13–0.9).

No major bleeding events occurred, and 2 \\npatients in each arm had clinically relevant, nonmajor bleeding. The open-label design and the inclusion \\nof asymptomatic events that were detected on screening ultrasounds and computed tomography scans \\nmay have biased the results. Additionally, two-thirds of the screened patients did not meet the eligibility \\ncriteria for the trial, which limits the generalizability of the results. \\nThe ACTIV-4c trial randomized 1,217 patients who were hospitalized for symptomatic COVID-19 for \\n>48 hours to receive apixaban 2.5 mg orally twice daily or placebo at hospital discharge.44 The 30-day \\ncomposite endpoint of all-cause mortality, venous thrombosis, or arterial thrombosis occurred in 2.13% \\nof patients in the apixaban arm and in 2.31% of patients in the placebo arm. Major bleeding events were \\ninfrequent, occurring in 2 patients (0.4%) in the apixaban arm and in 1 patient (0.2%) in the placebo \\narm. The trial's leadership and sponsors stopped the trial early because the event rate for the composite \\nendpoint was lower than expected, and the decreasing number of hospitalizations for people with \\nCOVID-19 made recruitment difficult.\\nAfter reviewing the results of the MICHELLE and ACTIV-4c trials, the Panel recommends against \\nroutinely continuing VTE prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge unless they \\nhave another indication for anticoagulation (AIIa). \\nAlthough there is no clear benefit of administering anticoagulation after hospital discharge in all patients \\nwith COVID-19, results from the MICHELLE trial, which evaluated patients with COVID-19, and the \\nMARINER trial, which evaluated patients who were hospitalized for other conditions and who had risk \\nfactors for VTE, suggest a possible benefit of using anticoagulation after discharge in patients who are at \\nhigh risk of VTE. The need for VTE prophylaxis after a COVID-19–related hospital discharge should be \\nassessed on a case-by-case basis. The criteria for assessing the risk of VTE in these patients are the same \\nas the criteria used for patients who are hospitalized for other acute illnesses. \\nPregnant and Lactating Patients\\nBecause pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state, the risk of thromboembolism is greater in pregnant \\nindividuals than in nonpregnant individuals.45 It is not yet known whether COVID-19 increases this \\nrisk, though some data do suggest that there is an increased risk. A cohort study in California compared \\nperinatal outcomes among almost 44,000 pregnant people with and without COVID-19.46 After adjusting \\nfor demographic factors and comorbidities, those with COVID-19 had a higher risk of severe maternal \\nmorbidity, preterm birth, and VTE. \\nIn several other cohort studies of pregnant women with COVID-19 in the United States and Europe, \\nVTE was not reported as a complication even among women with severe disease, although the receipt of \\nprophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation varied across the studies.47-49 Although there are currently not \\nenough data to recommend either for or against the use of VTE prophylaxis, the American College of \\nObstetricians and Gynecologists notes that VTE prophylaxis can reasonably be considered for pregnant \\nindividuals who are hospitalized with COVID-19, particularly those who have severe disease. If there \\nare no contraindications, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommends using heparin or LMWH \\nin pregnant patients who are critically ill or receiving mechanical ventilation.50 Several professional \\nsocieties, including the American Society of Hematology and the American College of Obstetricians \\nand Gynecologists, have guidelines that specifically address the management of VTE in the context of \\npregnancy.51,52 If delivery is imminent, or if there are other risks for bleeding, the risk of bleeding may \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Because of its \\nreliability and ease of administration, LMWH is recommended rather than UFH for the prevention and \\ntreatment of VTE in pregnant people.52 Direct-acting anticoagulants are not routinely recommended for \\nuse during pregnancy because of a lack of safety data for pregnant individuals.51 The use of warfarin to \\nprevent or treat VTE should be avoided in pregnant individuals regardless of their COVID-19 status, \\nespecially during the first trimester, due to the concern for teratogenicity.\\nSpecific recommendations for pregnant or lactating individuals with COVID-19 include:\\n• The Panel recommends that pregnant patients who are receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet \\ntherapies for underlying conditions continue these medications after they receive a diagnosis of \\nCOVID-19 (AIII). \\n• The Panel recommends the use of a prophylactic dose of anticoagulation for pregnant patients who \\nare hospitalized for manifestations of COVID-19, unless a contraindication exists (BIII). \\n• Because pregnant patients were not included in most of the clinical trials that evaluated the use of \\ntherapeutic anticoagulation in people with COVID-19, there is insufficient evidence for the Panel \\nto recommend either for or against the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in pregnant patients with \\nCOVID-19 who do not have evidence of VTE. \\n• As in nonpregnant patients with COVID-19, VTE prophylaxis after hospital discharge is not \\nroutinely recommended for pregnant patients (BIII). Clinicians should consider an individual \\npatient's VTE risk factors when making decisions about continuing VTE prophylaxis after \\ndischarge in pregnant or postpartum patients. \\n• The use of anticoagulant therapy during labor and delivery requires specialized care and planning. \\nThe management of anticoagulant therapy in pregnant patients with COVID-19 should be similar \\nto the management used for pregnant patients with other conditions (AIII). \\n• UFH, LMWH, and warfarin do not accumulate in breast milk and do not induce an anticoagulant \\neffect in the newborn; therefore, they can be used by breastfeeding individuals who require VTE \\nprophylaxis or treatment (AIII). \\nChildren With COVID-19 or MIS-C\\nFor the Panel’s recommendations on the use of antithrombotic therapy in children, see Therapeutic \\nManagement of Hospitalized Children With COVID-19 and Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized \\nChildren With MIS-C, Plus a Discussion on MIS-A.\\nReferences \\n1.

Fluvoxamine is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of any \\ninfection.\\nIn a murine sepsis model, fluvoxamine was found to bind to the sigma-1 receptor on immune cells, \\nresulting in reduced production of inflammatory cytokines.1 In an in vitro study of human endothelial \\ncells and macrophages, fluvoxamine reduced the expression of inflammatory genes.2 \\nRecommendations\\n• The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends against the use of \\nfluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19 in nonhospitalized patients (AIIa).\\n• There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of \\nthe combination of inhaled budesonide plus fluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19 in \\nnonhospitalized patients.\\n• Patients with COVID-19 who are receiving fluvoxamine for an underlying condition should \\ncontinue this therapy as directed by their health care provider (AIII).\\nRationale\\nSix randomized trials have studied the use of fluvoxamine for the treatment of nonhospitalized patients \\nwith COVID-19.3-8 The TOGETHER and STOP COVID 2 trials enrolled unvaccinated patients with \\nCOVID-19 who had at least 1 risk factor for disease progression.3,5 These studies did not identify \\na consistent benefit of using fluvoxamine in these patients, although STOP COVID 2 was stopped \\nearly due to low primary outcome rates. Other outpatient therapies (i.e., ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir \\n[Paxlovid], remdesivir) have been shown to be effective in preventing hospitalization or death in \\nunvaccinated patients who are at high risk of disease progression. In subsequent trials where the \\nmajority of enrolled patients were vaccinated against COVID-19, fluvoxamine did not significantly \\nreduce the risk of hospitalization or death, the time to recovery, or health care utilization.6-8 In several of \\nthese studies, fluvoxamine was associated with decreased adherence and/or an increase in the occurrence \\nof nonserious adverse effects, primarily gastrointestinal symptoms.3,5,6 \\nThe TOGETHER trial was a large, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive randomized trial in Brazil \\nthat evaluated the use of inhaled budesonide plus oral fluvoxamine in patients with COVID-19.9 Over \\n90% of the patients had received at least 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Treatment with this combination \\nsignificantly reduced the incidence of the primary outcome, which was a composite of hospitalization or \\nretention in an emergency setting for >6 hours. The proportion of patients who were hospitalized was the \\nsame in the treatment and placebo arms (0.9% vs. 1.1%), and the treatment did not significantly impact \\nsecondary outcomes such as health care attendance or the need for an emergency setting visit.

Fluvoxamine may enhance the anticoagulant effects of antiplatelets and anticoagulants. \\nPatients who are receiving these drugs should be closely monitored.\\nConsiderations in Pregnant People\\nFluvoxamine is not thought to increase the risk of congenital abnormalities; however, the data on its \\nuse in pregnant individuals are limited.11,12 An association between SSRI use in the late third trimester \\nand a small increase in the risk of primary persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns has not been \\nexcluded, although the absolute risk is likely low.13 \\nConsiderations in Children\\nFluvoxamine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children \\naged ≥8 years.14 The adverse effects of SSRI use seen in children are similar to those seen in adults, \\nalthough children and adolescents appear to have higher rates of activation and vomiting than adults.15 \\nThere are no data on the use of fluvoxamine for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in children. \\nReferences\\n1.

This recommendation should not preclude the use of \\nIVIG when it is otherwise indicated for the treatment of underlying conditions or complications \\nthat arise during the course of COVID-19.\\n• For the Panel’s recommendations on the use of IVIG in people with multisystem inflammatory \\nsyndrome in children (MIS-C) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) and a \\ndiscussion of the clinical data that support those recommendations, see Therapeutic Management \\nof Hospitalized Children With MIS-C, Plus a Discussion on MIS-A.\\nRationale\\nIt is unknown whether IVIG products derived from pooled donor plasma contain high titers of antibodies \\nthat neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Information on SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer was not reported in the \\nclinical trials that evaluated the use of IVIG for the treatment of COVID-19. The levels of SARS-CoV-2 \\nantibodies in IVIG products likely vary depending on which SARS-CoV-2 variant was dominant when \\nthe plasma products were collected, and different lots of IVIG may have different titers of antibodies. \\nAlthough IVIG preparations may have general immunomodulatory effects, these theoretical effects do \\nnot appear to benefit patients with COVID-19.1\\nConsiderations in Pregnant People\\nIVIG is commonly used during pregnancy for indications such as alloimmune thrombocytopenia.2 \\nHowever, because there is no clear evidence that IVIG is an effective treatment for acute COVID-19 \\nin nonpregnant adults, the Panel recommends against the use of IVIG for the treatment of acute \\nCOVID-19 in pregnant individuals, except in a clinical trial (AIII). This recommendation should not \\npreclude the use of IVIG when it is otherwise indicated for the treatment of underlying conditions or \\ncomplications that arise during the course of COVID-19.\\nConsiderations in Children\\nNo comparative studies have evaluated the use of IVIG in pediatric patients with acute COVID-19. \\nIVIG is used in combination with glucocorticoids to treat MIS-C in pediatric patients.3-6 However, \\nbecause there is no clear evidence that IVIG is an effective treatment for acute COVID-19 in adults, the \\nPanel recommends against the use of IVIG for the treatment of acute COVID-19 in children, except \\nin a clinical trial (AIII). This recommendation should not preclude the use of IVIG when it is otherwise \\nindicated. \\nFor the Panel’s recommendations for children with MIS-C, see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized \\nChildren With MIS-C, Plus a Discussion on MIS-A. \\nClinical Data\\nIn a meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials that enrolled hospitalized patients with COVID-19, \\nthe use of non-SARS-CoV-2–specific IVIG was not associated with a survival benefit.1 All of the \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

None of the studies measured the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Blood \\nsupplies collected since that time likely have a higher level of these antibodies, and the IVIG derived \\nfrom those supplies could be expected to have a higher level of SARS-specific antibodies. A British \\nstudy performed in 2022 evaluated serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titers before and after IVIG \\ninfusion in 35 patients with primary immunodeficiencies who were receiving regular immunoglobulin \\nreplacement therapy.7 The study found that anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titers and the neutralization \\ncapacity of serum increased after IVIG infusion in most patients.\\nDifferent brands of commercially available IVIG products exhibit different levels of neutralizing \\nactivity against SARS-CoV-2 variants (e.g., BA.1, BA.4, BA.5, BQ.1.1, XBB). A study compared the \\nanti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in U.S. IVIG products that had expiration dates from 2020 to 2025.8 \\nThe study found that products with expiration dates in 2023 and 2024 were more likely to have higher \\nlevels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than those with earlier expiration dates. In addition, the study \\nreported an association between later expiration dates and increased inhibition of angiotensin-converting \\nenzyme 2 binding activity. Preparations that were intended for intravenous administration had higher \\ntiters than those intended for subcutaneous administration. However, the neutralizing activity against the \\nOmicron variant was lower than the activity against prior variants, and the efficacy of using IVIG for the \\ntreatment of COVID-19 remains uncertain. \\nThese data do not provide clear evidence for a clinical benefit of administering IVIG to people with \\nCOVID-19. Randomized controlled trials are needed to further define the role of IVIG in the treatment \\nof COVID-19. The use of non-SARS-CoV-2–specific IVIG for the treatment of COVID-19 should be \\nlimited to clinical trials. \\nConcentrated antibody preparations derived from pooled plasma collected from individuals who have \\nrecovered from COVID-19 can be manufactured as SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmunoglobulin (hIVIG). \\nTreatment with SARS-CoV-2 hIVIG did not alter patient outcomes in a large randomized controlled \\ntrial of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and hIVIG is not currently available for clinical use in the \\nUnited States.9 \\nReferences\\n1.

See the FDA webpage Why You \\nShould Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19 for more information.\\nIvermectin has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures.3 However, \\npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations \\nnecessary for the antiviral efficacy detected in vitro would require administration of doses up to 100-fold \\nhigher than those approved for use in humans.4,5\\nThe safety and efficacy of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 have been \\nevaluated in clinical trials and observational cohorts. Summaries of the studies that informed the \\nCOVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel’s (the Panel) recommendation can be found in Table 7b. The \\nPanel reviewed additional studies, but these studies are not summarized in Table 7b because they have \\nstudy design limitations or results that make them less definitive and informative. \\nRecommendation\\n• The Panel recommends against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 (AIIa). \\nRationale\\nThe Panel’s recommendation is primarily informed by adequately powered, randomized trials of \\nivermectin that reported clinical outcomes. Studies that randomized participants to receive ivermectin or \\na matched placebo had the greatest impact on the Panel’s recommendation.6-13\\nTrials have failed to find a clinical benefit of using ivermectin to treat COVID-19 in outpatients. In \\nTOGETHER, an adaptive platform trial conducted in Brazil, there was no apparent difference between \\nthe ivermectin and placebo arms for the primary outcome of risk of emergency department visits \\nor hospitalization (14.7% vs. 16.4%).14 In addition, there was no statistically significant difference \\nbetween the ivermectin and placebo arms in mortality (3.1% vs. 3.5%). In COVID-OUT, a randomized \\nfactorial trial, the use of ivermectin did not reduce the occurrence of a composite outcome of emergency \\ndepartment visits, hospitalization, or death when compared with a matched control (5.7% vs. 4.1%).6 \\nThe ACTIV-6 trial was an adaptive platform trial conducted in outpatients with mild to moderate \\nCOVID-19 in the United States.15,16 Participants were randomized to receive an ivermectin regimen \\n(either 400 μg/kg for 3 days or 600 μg/kg for 6 days) or a matching placebo. In the 400 μg/kg phase of \\nthe study, the median time to sustained recovery was 12 days for the ivermectin arm and 13 days for the \\nplacebo arm. In the 600 μg/kg phase of the study, the median time to sustained recovery was 11 days for \\nboth arms.\\nI-TECH, an open-label trial conducted in Malaysia, found no difference between the ivermectin \\nand standard of care arms in the occurrence of the primary outcome of risk of progression to severe \\nCOVID-19 (21.6% vs. 17.3%).17 Patients in the ivermectin arm had a lower risk of mortality than those \\nin the standard of care arm (relative risk 0.31; 95% CI, 0.09–1.11; P = 0.09), but this difference was not \\nstatistically significant.\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In \\nthese randomized trials, completely excluding an effect of ivermectin on COVID-19 disease progression \\nis difficult because the trials were not powered to detect differences in secondary outcomes, such as \\ndeath. However, data from these trials do not provide evidence that the use of ivermectin is effective \\nfor the treatment of COVID-19. For this reason, and because other medications now have demonstrated \\nclear clinical benefits for the treatment of COVID-19, the Panel recommends against the use of \\nivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 (AIIa).\\nSee Table 7b for summaries of key studies that informed the Panel’s recommendation.\\nReferences\\n1.

These \\ntrials are described below and in Table 7c. \\nRecommendations\\n• There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) \\nto recommend either for or against the use of metformin for the treatment of COVID-19 in \\nnonhospitalized patients.\\n• The Panel recommends against the use of metformin for the treatment of COVID-19 in \\nhospitalized patients, except in a clinical trial (BIII).\\n• Patients with COVID-19 who are receiving metformin for an underlying condition should \\ncontinue this therapy as directed by their health care provider (AIII).\\nRationale\\nTwo randomized controlled trials (the TOGETHER and COVID-OUT trials) assessed the efficacy of \\nusing metformin in nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19. In these trials, the use of metformin did \\nnot reduce the risk of hospitalization or death in these patients. The Panel’s recommendations are based \\non the results of these trials. \\nOther outpatient therapies (i.e., ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir [Paxlovid], remdesivir, molnupiravir) have \\nbeen shown to be effective in preventing hospitalization or death in unvaccinated patients who are at \\nhigh risk of disease progression.\\nMonitoring, Adverse Effects, and Drug-Drug Interactions\\nThe most common adverse effects of metformin are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache. In rare \\ncases, lactic acidosis may occur. The risk factors associated with lactic acidosis include older age, \\nimpaired renal or hepatic function, the use of iodinated contrast dye, cardiac dysfunction, metabolic \\ndisturbances, and excessive alcohol consumption. Metformin is not recommended for patients with an \\nestimated glomerular filtration rate of <30 mL/min/1.73m2.\\nMetformin is a substrate of the human organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2. Drugs that inhibit \\nthese transporters may increase the systemic exposure of metformin and increase the risk of metformin-\\nrelated adverse effects. \\nConsiderations in Pregnant People\\nMetformin is commonly used in pregnant people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, because \\nclinical trials have not demonstrated a clear clinical benefit of using metformin in nonpregnant adults \\nwith COVID-19, there is no justification for administering it to pregnant people to treat COVID-19 \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Patients were \\nrandomized to receive extended-release metformin 750 mg (n = 215) or placebo (n = 203) twice daily \\nfor 10 days. \\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of retention in an emergency setting for >6 hours or \\nhospitalization within 28 days of randomization. Secondary endpoints included viral clearance at Days \\n3 and 7, clinical improvement at Day 28, time to hospitalization or death, and the occurrence of adverse \\nevents. The study was stopped by the data and safety monitoring board for futility, as there was a low \\nprobability of demonstrating a difference between the study arms. Overall, there was no difference \\nbetween the arms in the number of adverse events; however, the proportion of patients who experienced \\ngrade 3 events was higher in the metformin arm (9.8%) than in the placebo arm (4.4%).\\nCOVID-OUT Trial\\nThe COVID-OUT trial was a Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2 x 3 factorial trial that \\nevaluated the effectiveness of metformin, ivermectin, or fluvoxamine in patients with COVID-19.9 \\nPatients were randomized to receive metformin or placebo in 1 factor and ivermectin, fluvoxamine, \\nor placebo in the other factor. The study enrolled nonhospitalized adults within 3 days of a confirmed \\ndiagnosis of COVID-19 and ≤7 days from symptom onset. Patients were aged 30 to 85 years and \\noverweight. Those with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease or an estimated glomerular filtration rate of \\n<45 mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded. The metformin arm included those assigned to receive immediate-\\nrelease oral metformin (titrated over several days to a final daily dose of 1,500 mg) alone or in \\ncombination with ivermectin or fluvoxamine. The control arm included those who received placebo with \\nor without ivermectin or fluvoxamine.\\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of development of hypoxemia (defined as oxygen saturation \\n≤93%, as measured by a home pulse oximeter), emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death by \\nDay 14. While this study was underway, the Food and Drug Administration raised concerns about the \\naccuracy of home pulse oximeters. Approximately 50% of the patients received a primary COVID-19 \\nvaccine series. The analyses showed no benefit for any of the 3 investigational agents in preventing the \\nprimary endpoint. In addition, the use of these agents did not lower the severity of COVID-19 symptoms \\nover 14 days. A prespecified secondary analysis determined that, over 14 days of follow-up, those who \\nreceived metformin had a lower risk of an emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death than \\nthose who did not receive metformin (adjusted OR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35–0.94). A key secondary endpoint \\nin the analysis was a composite of hospitalization or death by Day 28.

The study was stopped early \\nby an operational and safety monitoring board due to futility after 214 of the planned 520 participants \\nwere enrolled. \\nPatients who received standard of care achieved a 50% reduction in their symptom severity scores at \\na mean of 6.7 days (SD 4.4 days) compared with 5.5 days (SD 3.7 days) in the ascorbic acid arm, 5.9 \\ndays (SD 4.9 days) in the zinc gluconate arm, and 5.5 days (SD 3.4 days) in the arm that received both \\nagents (overall P = 0.45).3 No serious adverse events related to the treatments were reported.

The data from these trials are summarized below.\\nClinical Data for Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19\\nTwo harmonized, randomized trials (LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP) evaluated intravenous (IV) \\nvitamin C versus a control in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 between July 2020 and July 2022.4 \\nThe studies enrolled patients from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America, and data from the 2 \\nstudies were analyzed together. Patients in intensive care units who were critically ill and receiving \\norgan support (1,568 patients from 90 sites) and hospitalized patients who were not critically ill (1,022 \\npatients from 40 sites) were randomized to a vitamin C arm or a control arm. Patients in the intervention \\narm received IV vitamin C every 6 hours for 96 hours, for a maximum of 16 doses. Patients in the \\ncontrol arm received either no vitamin C or placebo. The composite primary outcome was a measure \\nfor days free of organ support up to 21 days and survival to hospital discharge. The study terminated \\nenrollment after meeting criteria for harm and futility. \\nAmong patients who were critically ill, the vitamin C arm (n = 1,037) had a median of 7 days free \\nof organ support versus 10 days in the control arm (n = 531), with posterior probabilities of 8.6% for \\nvitamin C efficacy and 99.9% for futility.4 Among patients who were not critically ill, both the vitamin \\nC arm (n = 456) and the control arm (n = 566) had a median of 22 days free of organ support, with \\nposterior probabilities of 2.9% for vitamin C efficacy and >99.9% for futility.\\nThis study was limited by its use of combined data from 2 trials. The majority of patients enrolled were \\nfrom an open-label study that used response-adaptive randomization.4 In addition, the precision of the \\ntreatment effect estimate in critically ill patients was limited because enrollment was stopped for harm. \\nData on individual vaccination status and the vitamin C product administered were unavailable. The \\nstudy authors concluded that, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the probability that the use of \\nvitamin C would increase the number of days free of organ support was low. \\nIn a small, prospective, open-label randomized trial of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in \\nPakistan, patients were randomized to receive vitamin C 50 mg/kg IV daily plus standard therapy (n \\n= 75) or standard therapy alone (n = 75).5 Standard therapy included antipyretics, dexamethasone, and \\nprophylactic antibiotics. Vitamin C recipients became symptom-free earlier (7.1 days vs. 9.6 days; P < \\n0.0001) and had a shorter duration of hospitalization (8.1 days vs. 10.7 days; P < 0.0001) than patients \\nwho received standard therapy alone. There were no significant differences between the arms for the \\noutcomes of mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation.

Because the vitamin D receptor is present \\non immune cells such as B cells, T cells, and antigen-presenting cells, and because these cells can \\nsynthesize the active vitamin D metabolite, vitamin D also has the potential to modulate innate and \\nadaptive immune responses.1 It is postulated that these immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D could \\npotentially protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection or decrease the severity of COVID-19.\\nVitamin D deficiency (defined as a serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≤20 ng/mL) is \\ncommon in the United States, particularly among people who identified as Hispanic or non-Hispanic \\nBlack.2 These groups are overrepresented among cases of COVID-19 in the United States.3 Vitamin \\nD deficiency is also more common in older patients and patients with obesity and hypertension; these \\nfactors have been associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.4 High levels of vitamin D \\nmay cause hypercalcemia and nephrocalcinosis.5\\nRecommendation\\n• There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) \\nto recommend either for or against the use of vitamin D for the prevention or treatment of \\nCOVID-19.\\nRationale \\nThe results from several cohort studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses on the use of vitamin D for \\nthe prevention or treatment of COVID-19 have been published in peer-reviewed journals or have been \\nmade available as manuscripts ahead of peer review. However, most of these studies had significant \\nlimitations, such as small sample sizes or a lack of randomization and/or blinding. In addition, these \\nstudies used varying doses and formulations of vitamin D, enrolled participants with a range of \\nCOVID-19 severities, included different concomitant medications, and measured different study \\noutcomes. All these factors make it difficult to compare results across studies. The studies summarized \\nbelow are those that have had the greatest impact on the Panel's recommendations. \\nAlthough multiple observational cohort studies suggest that people with low vitamin D levels are \\nat increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and worse clinical outcomes after infection (e.g., higher \\nmortality), clear evidence that vitamin D supplementation provides protection against infection or \\nimproves outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is still lacking.6,7 \\nClinical Data on Vitamin D for Prevention \\nIn a double-blind trial conducted at 4 hospitals in Mexico, frontline health care workers were \\nrandomized to receive vitamin D3 4,000 IU or placebo for 30 days.8 Participants were enrolled before \\nCOVID-19 vaccines became available. Over one-third of the enrolled participants dropped out before \\nstudy completion. Of the 192 participants who completed follow-up, 6.4% of participants in the \\nvitamin D3 arm and 24.5% in the placebo arm acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection (relative risk 0.22; \\n95% CI, 0.08–0.59). At baseline, approximately 67% of participants had vitamin D deficiency, but this \\nwas not found to be an independent predictor of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. The frequency of \\nSARS-CoV-2 infection was very high in the placebo group, and it is unclear how these results translate \\nto the use of vitamin D in vaccinated health care workers. \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The \\nprimary outcome was length of hospital stay. The study found no significant difference in the median \\nlength of stay between the vitamin D3 arm (7.0 days; IQR 4.0–10.0 days) and the placebo arm (7.0 days; \\nIQR 5.0–13.0 days; log-rank P = 0.59). No significant differences were observed between the arms in \\nthe proportion of patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), the need for mechanical \\nventilation, or mortality. There were no significant safety concerns. \\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in Argentina included 218 adult \\npatients with COVID-19 who had been admitted to the hospital during the preceding 24 hours and \\nwho had oxygen saturation ≥90% on room air and a risk factor for disease progression.10 Patients were \\nrandomized to receive a single oral dose of vitamin D3 500,000 IU or placebo. The primary outcome was \\nthe change in the respiratory sepsis-related organ failure assessment (rSOFA) score between baseline and \\nthe highest value recorded up to Day 7. There was no significant difference between the arms for this \\noutcome, with a median change of 0 in both arms (P = 0.925). There were also no significant differences \\nbetween the arms in the median length of hospital stay, the number of patients admitted to the ICU, or \\nin-hospital mortality. \\nA randomized, open-label study conducted in France compared the effect of a high dose of vitamin \\nD3 (400,000 IU) to the standard dose of vitamin D3 (50,000 IU) on mortality in 254 patients who were \\neither hospitalized or living in nursing facilities near the study hospital sites.11 Patients were aged ≥65 \\nyears, had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection within the preceding 3 days, and had at least \\n1 risk factor for disease progression (i.e., aged ≥75 years, hypoxemia). Mortality was significantly \\ndifferent between the arms at 14 days, with 7 deaths (6%) among patients in the high-dose arm and 14 \\ndeaths (11%) among patients in the standard-dose arm (adjusted HR 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12–0.86; P = 0.02). \\nHowever, mortality was not significantly different between the arms at 28 days (adjusted HR 0.70; 95% \\nCI, 0.36–1.36; P = 0.29). \\nIn an open-label pilot study, 50 hospitalized adults in New York with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection were randomized to receive calcitriol 0.5 μg daily for 14 days or no treatment.12 Calcitriol is \\nthe active metabolite of cholecalciferol or vitamin D3 and is more commonly used to treat parathyroid \\ndisease. The study evaluated the change in oxygen saturation between patient admission and discharge. \\nAdditional outcomes were the length of hospital stay; mortality; and the need for endotracheal \\nintubation, ICU admission, or hospital readmission within 30 days. Oxygen saturation was calculated \\nusing the ratio of peripheral oxygen saturation (measured by pulse oximetry) to fraction of inspired \\noxygen (SpO2/FiO2) as a surrogate for the ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of \\ninspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2). Between admission and discharge, the patients who received no treatment \\nhad an average increase of 13.2 (SD 127.7) in the ratio, and those who received calcitriol had an \\nincrease of 91.04 (SD 119.08; P = 0.0305), implying an improvement in oxygenation.12 There were no \\ndifferences between the arms in the length of hospital stay, mortality, or the need for ICU admission or \\nhospital readmission. \\nReferences\\n1.

These patients are often prescribed medications to treat their \\nunderlying medical conditions. \\nEarly in the pandemic, some of these medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) \\ninhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs),1 HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins),2,3 and \\nhistamine-2 receptor antagonists,4 were hypothesized to offer potential as COVID-19 therapeutic agents. \\nOthers, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, were postulated to have negative impacts.5 \\nCurrently, there is no evidence that discontinuing medication for underlying medical conditions offers \\na clinical benefit for patients with COVID-19.6-8 For example, the Food and Drug Administration stated \\nthat there is no evidence linking the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents with worsening of \\nCOVID-19 and advised patients to use them as directed.9 Additionally, the American Heart Association, \\nthe Heart Failure Society of America, and the American College of Cardiology issued a joint statement \\nthat renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists, such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, should be \\ncontinued as prescribed in those with COVID-19.10 \\nTherefore, patients with COVID-19 who are treated with concomitant medications for an underlying \\nmedical condition should not discontinue ACE inhibitors and ARBs (AIIa) or other medications \\n(AIII) unless discontinuation is otherwise warranted by their clinical condition. For patients with \\nCOVID-19 who require nebulized medications, precautions should be taken to minimize the potential \\nfor transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the home and in health care settings.11,12\\nThe COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommends against using medications off-label to \\ntreat COVID-19 if they have not been shown to be safe and effective for this indication in a clinical \\ntrial (AIII). Clinicians should refer to the Therapies section of the Guidelines for information on the \\nmedications that have been studied as potential therapeutic options for patients with COVID-19. \\nWhen prescribing medications to treat COVID-19, clinicians should always assess the patient’s \\ncurrent medications for potential drug-drug interactions and additive adverse effects. The decision to \\ncontinue or change a patient’s medications should be individualized based on their specific clinical \\ncondition.

Moreover, some immunodeficiencies seem to \\nincrease the risk above and beyond traditional risk factors. For example, there is evidence that individuals \\nwho make autoantibodies to type I interferons (proteins that are critical to the protective immune \\nresponse against viral infections) have a higher risk of severe COVID-19.8 Similarly, certain classes \\nof medications, such as T cell–depleting or T cell–suppressing agents (e.g., antithymocyte globulin, \\ncalcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, belatacept) and B cell–depleting agents (e.g., rituximab, \\nocrelizumab, obinutuzumab), have been associated with more severe disease and death.7,9,10\\nProlonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in patients who are immunocompromised. A \\nsystematic review found that replication-competent virus could be detected for a median of 20 days in \\nthese patients, compared to 11 days in the general population.11 Prolonged viral shedding may affect \\nSARS-CoV-2 testing strategies and isolation durations for this group of patients. Moreover, case reports \\nsuggest that prolonged infections can create evolutionary pressure for the emergence of variants that \\nresist therapies or evade vaccine-induced immunity.12-14 \\nFor any person who is eligible, clinicians should prescribe therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 \\nas recommended in these Guidelines. However, if logistical constraints limit the availability of \\ntherapies, the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) suggests prioritizing the treatment \\nof patients with COVID-19 who are at the highest risk of clinical progression (see Prioritization of \\nAnti-SARS-CoV-2 Therapies for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Nonhospitalized Patients When There \\nAre Logistical Constraints). Providers should use their clinical judgment when prioritizing patients for \\ntreatment and assess a patient’s immunocompromised status, age, comorbidities, and vaccination status. \\nThe sections below outline the Panel’s rationale for the recommendations on preventing and managing \\nCOVID-19 in people who are immunocompromised.

The Panel recommends COVID-19 vaccination for everyone who is eligible, \\nincluding those who are immunocompromised, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \\nPrevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (AI).\\nAuthorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines in the United States are not live-virus vaccines and \\ncan be safely administered to patients who are immunocompromised. However, in people who \\nare immunocompromised, the immune response to vaccination may be blunted, and the timing of \\nvaccination requires special consideration. Nevertheless, vaccination is still recommended, as it \\nmay confer partial protection, including the protection provided by vaccine-induced, cell-mediated \\nimmunity.15\\nThe Panel recommends following the CDC’s COVID-19 vaccination guidance for people who are \\nmoderately or severely immunocompromised. This guidance includes information on the use of the \\nupdated 2023–2024 mRNA vaccines, which target the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant lineage XBB.1.5. \\nCurrent CDC guidance allows for the use of additional vaccine doses in people who are moderately or \\nseverely immunocompromised.16 Data on the optimal timing for repeat vaccination in people who are \\nimmunocompromised are lacking; the CDC recommends an interval of at least 2 months after the last \\ndose. Other considerations include the patient’s current or expected level of immunosuppression, their \\nage, comorbidities, and the time since their last vaccine dose. Clinicians should also account for the \\nprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community and whether the patient intends to travel. \\nA preprint of a large observational study from Israel suggests a potential benefit from administering \\nCOVID-19 boosters every 6 months in groups with the highest risk of COVID-19–related \\nhospitalization or death.17 The CDC-funded VISION Network evaluated the effectiveness of bivalent \\nvaccines between September 13, 2022, and April 21, 2023, at 5 sites in 7 states.18 Among adults who \\nwere immunocompromised, a lower vaccine effectiveness was observed for the bivalent booster, but \\nvaccine effectiveness was sustained against critical COVID-19–associated outcomes, including intensive \\ncare unit admission and death. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was 28% during the first \\n7 to 59 days after receipt of the bivalent dose and declined to 13% by 120 to 179 days; this indirectly \\nsupports using a 6-month interval for repeat vaccination.\\nThe pivotal clinical trials that evaluated the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines excluded \\npeople who were severely immunocompromised; therefore, the data for this population are less robust.19,20 \\nObservational data suggest that serological responses to vaccines may be blunted in patients who are \\nimmunocompromised.21,22 However, the MELODY trial reported detectable immunoglobulin G spike \\nprotein antibodies in approximately 80% of a large cohort of individuals in the United Kingdom who \\nwere immunocompromised and had received at least 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccines.23 Those who had \\nreceived anti-CD20 therapies within the past year were less likely than other groups in the study to have \\ndetectable anti-spike protein antibodies.

The timing of the vaccination should be determined based on the \\npatient’s current or planned immunosuppressive therapies, as well as the patient’s medical condition and \\npredicted response to the vaccine. Guidance about the timing of COVID-19 vaccination in solid organ \\ntransplant, HCT, and cellular immunotherapy candidates can be found in Special Considerations in Solid \\nOrgan Transplant, Hematopoietic Cell Transplant, and Cellular Immunotherapy Candidates, Donors, \\nand Recipients. The CDC’s guidance allows the use of additional vaccine doses in people who are \\nimmunocompromised. Each additional dose should be administered at least 2 months after the last dose. \\nThe CDC recommends that HCT and CAR T-cell recipients who received doses of COVID-19 \\nvaccines before or during treatment with HCT or CAR T-cell therapy should be revaccinated with the \\ncurrently recommended primary vaccine series at least 3 months after the transplant or CAR T-cell \\ntherapy.16 The American College of Rheumatology also provides guidance for temporarily stopping \\nimmunosuppressive regimens during vaccination.27 \\nPolyethylene Glycol Allergies\\nThe BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) mRNA vaccines contain polyethylene \\nglycol (PEG), whereas the NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) vaccine contains polysorbate 80. PEG and \\npolysorbate are used in many products, including in agents used for cancer chemotherapy (e.g., PEG-\\nasparaginase). PEG and polysorbate are structurally related, and cross-reactive hypersensitivity between \\nthese compounds might occur. The detection of PEG antibodies after vaccination was not associated \\nwith increased adverse reactions (such as delayed-onset reactions, including injection site rashes, or \\nsevere allergic reactions) to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.28 Therefore, testing for anti-PEG antibodies \\nshould not be used as a screening tool to assess the risk of allergic reactions29 and should not replace \\nan assessment by a specialist in those rare individuals with a history of anaphylaxis.30 The CDC has \\nissued guidance on triaging people with a history of allergies or allergic reactions to the components of \\nCOVID-19 vaccines. \\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis\\nAs of February 2024, no biomedical intervention other than vaccines prevents COVID-19 disease. \\nPreviously, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the use of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 \\nmonoclonal antibodies tixagevimab plus cilgavimab (Evusheld) as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) \\nof COVID-19 in certain people who were not expected to mount an adequate immune response to \\nCOVID-19 vaccination and in people with COVID-19 vaccine contraindications.

When selecting \\ntreatments for COVID-19, clinicians should consider factors such as the underlying disease; the specific \\nimmunosuppressants being used; the severity of COVID-19; and the potential for drug-drug interactions, \\noverlapping toxicities, and secondary infections.\\nEarly in the clinical course of COVID-19, the disease is primarily driven by the replication of \\nSARS-CoV-2. Immunosuppressive medications can reduce the host immune responses that suppress \\nviral replication, increasing the risk of prolonged viral shedding and infection.34,35 Clinicians \\nshould consider adjusting the doses of immunosuppressive medications or substituting certain \\nimmunosuppressive medications, if possible, to improve the patient’s immune response to infection. \\nWhen making decisions about stopping or reducing the dose of immunosuppressive drugs, clinicians \\nshould balance the potential benefit of enhancing the patient’s immune response to COVID-19 with the \\nrisk of exacerbating the underlying condition. They should also consider the role of immunomodulation \\nin the treatment of COVID-19. \\nClinicians should be aware that many immunosuppressive drugs, particularly biologic agents, have long \\nhalf-lives or prolonged periods of biologic activity. Patients may remain immunosuppressed long after \\nthe drugs are stopped. Care should be taken to not stop glucocorticoids abruptly, since this may result \\nin adrenal insufficiency. For medications other than glucocorticoids, decisions about dose adjustments \\nshould be made on a case-by-case basis. For example, for some autoimmune diseases, temporary \\ncessation of immunosuppression is often possible, and restarting medications 7 to 14 days after symptom \\nresolution may be appropriate.27,36 Observational data suggest that patients receiving tumor necrosis \\nfactor–alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors may be at lower risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 than those \\nreceiving treatment with other immunomodulators.37,38 Therefore, some patients with mild COVID-19 \\nmay safely continue receiving treatment with TNF-alpha inhibitors.\\nFor solid organ transplant recipients, adjustments to immunosuppressive regimens should be \\nindividualized based on disease severity, the risk of graft rejection, the specific immunosuppressants \\nbeing used, the type of transplant, the time since transplantation, the concentration of \\nimmunosuppressants, and the potential for drug-drug interactions.39 See Special Considerations in Solid \\nOrgan Transplant, Hematopoietic Cell Transplant, and Cellular Immunotherapy Candidates, Donors, and \\nRecipients for more information.\\nTherapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Patients With COVID-19\\nFor nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are immunocompromised, the Panel \\nrecommends prompt treatment with antiviral drugs at the doses and durations recommended for the \\ngeneral population (AIII).

In subsequent retrospective studies, some potential \\nbenefits of using ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir in people with various immunocompromising conditions \\nhave been observed.41,42\\nA retrospective study investigated the use of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir for the treatment of \\nCOVID-19 in patients who were moderately or severely immunocompromised.43 Among 3,188 patients, \\nthe use of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir reduced the risk of death or hospitalization in extremely \\nvulnerable patients, such as those with solid organ, bone marrow, or stem cell transplants; those with \\nsevere primary immunodeficiencies; and those receiving B cell–depletion therapy or treatment for \\nhematologic malignancies.\\nBecause ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is the only highly effective oral antiviral therapy for COVID-19, \\nit should be considered for patients who are immunocompromised if there are no potentially significant \\ndrug-drug interactions or if the interactions can be safely managed. Clinicians should be aware of \\ndrug-drug interactions that may be life- or organ-threatening (see Drug-Drug Interactions Between \\nRitonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir [Paxlovid] and Concomitant Medications).44 Notably, calcineurin \\ninhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine A) and mammalian target of rapamycin drugs (e.g., sirolimus, \\neverolimus) have important drug-drug interactions with ritonavir. For this reason, the American Society \\nof Transplantation recommends preferentially using other therapies, such as remdesivir, over ritonavir-\\nboosted nirmatrelvir in people who are taking calcineurin inhibitors or mammalian target of rapamycin \\ninhibitors.39 Ritonavir can inhibit the metabolism of many cancer-directed therapies and should only \\nbe given after consulting with specialty pharmacists and other appropriate specialists. Remdesivir \\nand molnupiravir are other antiviral options for individuals who cannot receive ritonavir-boosted \\nnirmatrelvir because of drug-drug interactions.\\nObservational studies and the EPIC-HR and MOVe-OUT trials have described SARS-CoV-2 viral \\nrebound and the recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms in some patients who have completed treatment \\nwith ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir or molnupiravir.45-49 However, viral rebound can also occur in \\npatients who have not received treatment for COVID-19.50 Some observational studies have reported \\nthat patients who were treated with ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir had a higher frequency of viral \\nrebound and symptom recurrence than those who did not receive treatment.51,52 \\nTo date, virus detection and the recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms following the use of antiviral \\ntherapies have not been associated with progression to severe COVID-19.53,54 Therefore, concerns \\nabout viral rebound or the recurrence of symptoms should not be a reason to avoid using antiviral \\ntherapies when their use is indicated.49,55-57 A clinical trial that is evaluating the use of a second course of \\nritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir to treat patients with viral rebound and symptom recurrence is underway \\n(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT05567952).

For patients who are \\nimmunocompromised, are receiving minimal levels of conventional oxygen, and are earlier in the course \\nof COVID-19 (e.g., those with <10 days of symptoms), the preferred approach may be emphasizing \\nsupportive care, using antiviral therapy, and avoiding corticosteroids. This strategy may reduce the \\nduration of viral replication and the risk of secondary infections.

The \\nrecommended dose of dexamethasone is 6 mg, which is equivalent to 40 mg of prednisone. This is \\nthe minimum dose of a steroid that should be used.

For more \\ninformation, see Drug-Drug Interactions Between Ritonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and \\nConcomitant Medications.

Physiologic changes, such as reduced pulmonary \\nresidual capacity, may also contribute to respiratory disease severity.102-105 Pregnant people who have \\nunderlying immunocompromising conditions or are receiving immunosuppressive medications likely \\nhave an even higher risk of severe disease. This patient group should be prioritized for the prevention \\nand treatment of COVID-19. \\nPrevention\\nThe Panel recommends COVID-19 vaccination for everyone who is eligible, including pregnant and \\nlactating individuals, according to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (AI). \\nCOVID-19 vaccination is strongly recommended for pregnant individuals due to their increased risk \\nfor severe disease.106,107 Vaccination is especially important for pregnant people with concomitant \\nrisk factors such as underlying immunocompromising conditions (including those who are receiving \\nimmunosuppressive medications), as the risk for severe disease is likely additive.100\\nTreatment\\nAlthough pregnant patients have been excluded from the majority of the clinical trials that evaluated \\nthe use of COVID-19 therapeutics, pregnant patients with COVID-19 can be treated the same as \\nnonpregnant patients, with a few exceptions. Pregnant patients who are immunocompromised or who \\nhave other risk factors likely have an even higher risk of severe COVID-19 and should be prioritized \\nfor treatment. Providers should refer to Pregnancy, Lactation, and COVID-19 Therapeutics for the \\nPanel’s guidance on treating COVID-19 in pregnant and lactating patients. Pregnant people who \\nare immunocompromised are a heterogeneous group of patients, ranging from those who are mildly \\nimmunocompromised to those who are severely immunocompromised. Evaluating and managing \\npregnant patients require collaboration from a multidisciplinary team.

Few \\nchildren, if any, have been enrolled in clinical trials of treatments for COVID-19. Among the children \\nwho were enrolled, very few were immunocompromised. Therefore, clinicians should be cautious when \\napplying recommendations based on adult data to children. Clinicians need to consider the potential \\nrisks and benefits of therapy, the severity of the patient’s disease, and underlying risk factors. See \\nTherapeutic Management of Hospitalized Children With COVID-19 and Therapeutic Management \\nof Nonhospitalized Children With COVID-19 for the Panel’s treatment recommendations in these \\nscenarios.\\nReferences\\n1.

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends COVID-19 vaccination for everyone who is \\neligible, including patients with active cancer and patients receiving treatment for cancer, according to the Centers for \\nDisease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (AI).\\n • See the CDC webpage COVID-19 Vaccines for People Who Are Moderately or Severely Immunocompromised for the \\ncurrent COVID-19 vaccination schedule.\\n • Vaccinating household members, close contacts, and health care providers who provide care to patients with cancer \\nis important to protect these patients from infection.

See the CDC webpage COVID-19 Vaccines for \\nPeople Who Are Moderately or Severely Immunocompromised for the current COVID-19 vaccination \\nschedule.\\nObservational data suggest that serological responses to vaccines may be blunted in patients who are \\nimmunocompromised.8,9 However, vaccination is still recommended for these patients because it may \\nprovide partial protection, including protection from vaccine-induced, cell-mediated immunity.\\nVaccinating household members, close contacts, and health care providers who provide care to patients \\nwith cancer is important to protect these patients from infection. Clinicians should strongly encourage \\nall household members and close contacts of patients with cancer to be vaccinated against COVID-19 \\n(AI). There is evidence that vaccinated individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have lower viral loads \\nthan unvaccinated individuals10,11 and that COVID-19 vaccines reduce the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfections not only among vaccinated individuals but also among their household contacts.12-14 \\nWhen determining the timing of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with cancer, clinicians should \\nconsider the following factors:\\n• If possible, patients planning to receive chemotherapy should receive vaccinations for COVID-19 \\nat least 2 weeks before starting chemotherapy.15,16\\n• COVID-19 vaccines can be offered as early as 3 months after a patient receives hematopoietic cell \\nor chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy.16 \\n• Graft-versus-host disease symptoms may flare after COVID-19 vaccination.17 No immune-related \\nadverse events were reported after COVID-19 vaccination in 2 studies of patients with cancer who \\nreceived immune checkpoint inhibitors.18,19 \\nDecreased immunologic responses to COVID-19 vaccination have been reported in patients receiving \\ntreatment for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.9,20 The type of therapy has been shown to \\ninfluence the patient’s response to vaccination. For example, people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia \\nwho were treated with Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors or venetoclax with or without anti-CD20 \\nantibodies had extremely low response rates (16.0% and 13.6%, respectively).20 In comparison, \\napproximately 80% to 95% of patients with solid tumors showed immunologic responses.9,21,22 Several \\nobservational studies support the use of a third vaccine dose in patients with cancer, even though vaccine \\nfailure may still occur.23-25 See the CDC website COVID-19 Vaccines for People Who Are Moderately or \\nSeverely Immunocompromised for guidance on vaccine dosing. \\nPolyethylene Glycol Allergies\\nThe BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) mRNA vaccines contain polyethylene \\nglycol (PEG), whereas the NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) vaccine contains polysorbate 80.26 PEG and \\npolysorbate are used in many products, including in agents used for cancer chemotherapy (e.g., PEG-\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to \\npatients and health care workers has been reported.34-36 Health care providers and patients should take \\nprecautions to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection, including wearing a mask and \\npracticing good hand hygiene.37 Telemedicine can minimize the need for in-person services and reduce \\nthe risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. For people who have difficulty accessing health care, telemedicine \\nmay improve access to providers, but it could worsen disparities if these populations have limited access \\nto technology.\\nDecisions about treatment regimens, surgery, and radiation therapy for the underlying malignancy should \\nbe made on a case-by-case basis, and clinicians should consider the biology of the cancer, the need for \\nhospitalization, the number of clinic visits required, and the anticipated degree of immunosuppression. \\nCancer treatment regimens that do not affect the outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with cancer may not \\nneed to be altered.

See \\nTherapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for more information. In patients with \\nCOVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, the use of dexamethasone has \\nbeen associated with lower mortality than standard of care treatment alone.42 In patients with cancer, \\ndexamethasone is commonly used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea, as a part of tumor-directed \\ntherapy, and to treat inflammation associated with brain metastasis. The side effects of dexamethasone \\nare expected to be the same in patients with cancer as in those without cancer. \\nThe immunomodulators baricitinib, tocilizumab, abatacept, or inflixamab used in combination with \\ndexamethasone are recommended for some patients with severe or critical COVID-19 who exhibit rapid \\nrespiratory decompensation (see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19).43-\\n46 The risks and benefits of using dexamethasone in combination with another immunomodulator in \\npatients with cancer who recently received chemotherapy is unknown. Because dexamethasone and the \\nother immunomodulators are immunosuppressive agents, patients who receive these medications should \\nbe closely monitored for secondary infections. \\nTherapeutic anticoagulation for patients with cancer who are hospitalized for COVID-19 should be \\nmanaged similarly to anticoagulation for other hospitalized patients. Patients with platelet counts \\n<50,000 cells/µL should not receive therapeutic anticoagulation for COVID-19.

The optimal time to initiate or restart cancer-directed therapies after the infection has \\nresolved is unclear. If possible, clinicians should withhold treatment until COVID-19 symptoms have \\nresolved. Prolonged viral shedding may occur in patients with cancer,2 although it is unknown how this \\nrelates to infectious virus or outcomes. The decision to restart cancer treatments in this setting should be \\nmade on a case-by-case basis. Clinicians should consult with a hematologist or oncologist when making \\ndecisions about stopping or adjusting the doses of cancer-directed medications in patients with cancer \\nand COVID-19.\\nDrug-Drug Interactions\\nThe use of antiviral or immune-based therapies to treat COVID-19 can present additional challenges \\nin patients with cancer.

Boosting with ritonavir, \\na strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor, is required to increase the exposure of nirmatrelvir to \\na concentration that is effective against SARS-CoV-2. Ritonavir may also increase concentrations of \\ncertain concomitant medications, including some chemotherapeutic agents and immunotherapies used \\nto treat cancer. Significant increases in the concentrations of these drugs may lead to serious or life-\\nthreatening drug toxicities. Additionally, ritonavir is an inhibitor, inducer, and substrate of various other \\ndrug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. \\nBefore prescribing ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, clinicians should carefully review the patient’s \\nconcomitant medications, including over-the-counter medications, herbal supplements, and recreational \\ndrugs, to evaluate potential drug-drug interactions. Clinicians should refer to resources such as the \\nLiverpool COVID-19 Drug Interactions website, Drug-Drug Interactions Between Ritonavir-Boosted \\nNirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and Concomitant Medications, and the Food and Drug Administration’s \\nprescribing information for ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir for guidance on identifying and managing \\npotential drug-drug interactions. If significant interactions prohibit the concomitant use of ritonavir-\\nboosted nirmatrelvir, another antiviral treatment option should be used (see Therapeutic Management of \\nNonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19). \\nDexamethasone is commonly used as an antiemetic for patients with cancer and is recommended for the \\ntreatment of certain patients with COVID-19 (see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With \\nCOVID-19). Dexamethasone is a weak to moderate CYP3A4 inducer; therefore, interactions with any \\nCYP3A4 substrates need to be considered. \\nSpecial Considerations in Children\\nPreliminary published reports suggest that pediatric patients with cancer may have milder manifestations \\nof COVID-19 than adult patients with cancer, although larger studies are needed.47-49 Guidance on \\nmanaging children with cancer and COVID-19 is available from an international group that received \\ninput from the International Society of Paediatric Oncology, the Children’s Oncology Group, St. \\nJude Global, and Childhood Cancer International.50 Guidance on managing specific malignancies \\nand supportive care and weblinks relevant to the care of children with cancer and COVID-19 are \\navailable in 2 publications authored by groups of experts.50,51 Special considerations for the treatment \\nof children with COVID-19, including those who are immunocompromised, can be found in \\nTherapeutic Management of Hospitalized Children With COVID-19 and Therapeutic Management of \\nNonhospitalized Children With COVID-19. \\nReferences\\n1.

Transplant recipients may also have a higher \\nrisk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 given their frequent contact with the health care system. Since \\nimmunosuppressive agents modulate several aspects of immune response, the severity of COVID-19 \\ncould potentially be affected by the type and intensity of the immunosuppressive effect of the agent, as \\nwell as by specific combinations of immunosuppressive agents. Some transplant recipients have medical \\ncomorbidities that have been associated with more severe cases of COVID-19 and a greater risk of \\nmortality, which makes the impact of transplantation on disease severity difficult to assess. \\nThe International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Society of Transplantation, \\nthe American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, and the European Society for Blood \\nand Marrow Transplantation provide guidance for clinicians who are caring for transplant recipients \\nwith COVID-19 and guidance on screening potential donors and transplant or cellular immunotherapy \\ncandidates. In addition, the American Society of Hematology offers guidance regarding COVID-19 \\nvaccination for transplant and cellular immunotherapy recipients. \\nThis section of the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines complements these sources and focuses on \\nconsiderations for managing COVID-19 in solid organ transplant, HCT, and cellular immunotherapy \\nrecipients. The optimal management and therapeutic approach to COVID-19 in these populations is \\nunknown. At this time, the procedures for evaluating and managing COVID-19 in transplant recipients \\nare the same as those for nontransplant patients (AIII). See Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized \\nAdults With COVID-19 and Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 for \\nmore information. The risks and benefits of each medication used to treat COVID-19 may be different \\nfor transplant patients and nontransplant patients. \\nCOVID-19 Vaccination\\nThe clinical trials that evaluated the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines excluded \\npatients who were severely immunocompromised.1,2 Authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccines \\nin the United States are not live-virus vaccines and can be safely administered to patients who are \\nimmunocompromised. However, solid organ transplant recipients have reduced immunological antibody \\nresponses following a primary 2-dose or 3-dose series of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.3-6 \\nCOVID-19 vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent serious outcomes and death \\nfrom SARS-CoV-2 infection. The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends \\nCOVID-19 vaccination for everyone who is eligible, including transplant and cellular immunotherapy \\ncandidates and recipients, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) \\nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (AI).

In solid organ \\ntransplant recipients with or without COVID-19, acute cellular rejection should not be presumed without \\nbiopsy confirmation.20 Similarly, in recipients with or without COVID-19 who have had rejection \\nconfirmed by a biopsy, immunosuppressive therapy should be initiated.\\nData on the incidence and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCT27 and cellular \\nimmunotherapy recipients are limited.28 Data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow \\nTransplant Research demonstrated that approximately 30% of a cohort of 318 HCT recipients died \\nwithin 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis.27 This probability of mortality was observed in both allogeneic \\nand autologous recipients. Older age (≥50 years), male sex, and receipt of a COVID-19 diagnosis within \\n12 months of transplantation were associated with a higher risk of mortality among allogeneic recipients. \\nIn autologous recipients, patients with lymphoma had a higher risk of mortality than patients who had \\nplasma cell disorder or myeloma. \\nA smaller study demonstrated slightly lower mortality among HCT and cellular immunotherapy \\nrecipients than earlier reports. This study found that the number of comorbidities, the presence of \\ninfiltrates on initial chest imaging, and neutropenia were predictors for increased disease severity.29 \\nAdditional factors that have been used to determine the clinical severity of other respiratory viral \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

See Therapeutic \\nManagement of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19, Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized \\nAdults With COVID-19 and Special Considerations in People Who Are Immunocompromised for more \\ninformation. \\nFor nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are transplant or cellular \\nimmunotherapy recipients, the Panel recommends prompt treatment with antiviral drugs at the doses and \\ndurations recommended for the general population (AIII). In hospitalized people with severe COVID-19 \\nwho required supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, data from a large randomized controlled \\ntrial found that a short course of dexamethasone (6 mg once daily for up to 10 days) improved survival.31 \\nA second immunomodulator (e.g., baricitinib, tocilizumab, abatacept, infliximab) used in combination \\nwith dexamethasone is recommended for some patients with severe or critical COVID-19.31-34 Because \\ndexamethasone and the other immunomodulators are immunosuppressive agents, patients who receive \\nthese medications should be closely monitored for secondary infections. \\nTherapeutic anticoagulation for transplant recipients who are hospitalized for COVID-19 should be \\nmanaged similarly to anticoagulation for other hospitalized patients. Patients with platelet counts \\n<50,000 cells/µL should not receive therapeutic anticoagulation for COVID-19. Clinicians should follow \\nhospital protocols for managing anticoagulation in patients with thrombocytopenia.\\nThe Panel’s recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 \\ncan be found in Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19.\\nConcomitant Medications \\nClinicians should pay special attention to the potential for drug-drug interactions and overlapping \\ntoxicities between treatments for COVID-19 and concomitant medications, such as immunosuppressants \\nused to prevent or treat allograft rejection and antimicrobials used to prevent or treat opportunistic \\ninfections. Dose modifications may be necessary for drugs used to treat COVID-19 in transplant \\nrecipients with pre-existing organ dysfunction. Adjustments to the immunosuppressive regimen \\nshould be individualized based on disease severity, the specific immunosuppressants used, the type \\nof transplant, the time since transplantation, the drug concentration, and the risk of graft rejection.23 \\nClinicians should consult with a transplant specialist when making decisions about stopping or \\nadjusting the doses of immunosuppressive drugs in transplant or cellular immunotherapy recipients with \\nCOVID-19.\\nDrug-Drug Interactions\\nCalcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) \\ninhibitors (e.g., everolimus, sirolimus), which are commonly used to prevent allograft rejection, have \\nnarrow therapeutic indices. Medications that inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or \\nP-glycoprotein may put patients who receive these drugs at risk of clinically significant drug-drug \\ninteractions, increasing the need for therapeutic drug monitoring and the need to assess for signs of \\ntoxicity or rejection.35 \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

If remdesivir is not available or feasible to use, a 5-day course of ritonavir-boosted \\nnirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) may be used with caution and only when close therapeutic drug monitoring of \\nthe antirejection therapy is possible. Clinicians should consult with transplant specialists throughout \\nthe treatment. Boosting with ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, is required to increase the exposure \\nof nirmatrelvir to a concentration that is effective against SARS-CoV-2. Ritonavir may also increase \\nconcentrations of certain concomitant medications, including calcineurin and mTOR inhibitors, \\nduring the treatment course and for ≥3 days after ritonavir is discontinued. Significant increases in the \\nconcentrations of these drugs may lead to serious or life-threatening drug toxicities. \\nGeneral guidance for coadministering ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir with concomitant medications \\nincludes temporarily withholding certain immunosuppressive agents (e.g., tacrolimus, everolimus, \\nsirolimus) or reducing the dosage of certain immunosuppressive agents (e.g., cyclosporine), monitoring \\nthe patient closely for toxicities, and performing therapeutic drug monitoring during and after the 5-day \\ntreatment course of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir.36,37 \\nSome small case series have reported success using these recommendations to manage patients.38,39 \\nHowever, cases of significant toxicities due to supratherapeutic tacrolimus concentrations have also \\nbeen reported.40 Therapeutic drug monitoring should be used to guide the process of reintroducing or \\nmodifying the doses of calcineurin and mTOR inhibitors in patients who have completed a course of \\nritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. Clinicians should also consult with a specialist who has experience with \\ndose management. Clinicians should take additional precautions when treating transplant recipients who \\nare also receiving other concomitant medications (e.g., certain triazole antifungals) that may interact \\nwith ritonavir, the immunosuppressants, or both. The extent and significance of multiple drug-drug \\ninteractions are much more complex and unpredictable.\\nClinicians should refer to resources such as the Liverpool COVID-19 Drug Interactions website, \\nDrug-Drug Interactions Between Ritonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and Concomitant \\nMedications, and the Food and Drug Administration prescribing information for ritonavir-boosted \\nnirmatrelvir for guidance on identifying and managing potential drug-drug interactions. If significant \\ninteractions prohibit the concomitant use of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, another COVID-19 treatment \\noption should be used (see Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19).\\nAmong the drugs commonly used to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19, dexamethasone is \\na moderate inducer of CYP3A4, and interleukin-6 inhibitors may lead to increased metabolism of \\nCYP substrates. Clinicians should closely monitor the serum concentrations of calcineurin and mTOR \\ninhibitors when these drugs are used. \\nAdditional details about the adverse effects and drug-drug interactions of antiviral medications and \\nimmune-based therapies for COVID-19 are noted in Tables 4e and 5e.\\nReferences\\n1.

Among the cases of SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection, 59.5% occurred early in pregnancy, 13.5% occurred 7 to 30 days before delivery, and 27% \\noccurred <7 days before delivery. The adjusted risk of severe maternal morbidity was 2.22 times higher \\nfor pregnant individuals who were infected <7 days before delivery and 1.67 times higher for those who \\nwere infected 7 to 30 days before delivery, when compared with the risk for pregnant individuals who \\ndelivered and had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. The study also reported that at \\nthe time of hospitalization for delivery, severe maternal morbidity was associated with younger (15–25 \\nyears) and older maternal (>35 years) ages, non-Hispanic Black race, lower household income and \\neducational attainment, pre-existing medical conditions, and diagnosed pregnancy complications. \\nObstetric and Perinatal Outcomes in Patients With COVID-19 \\nAn observational cohort study at 33 U.S. hospitals evaluated the maternal characteristics and outcomes \\nacross disease severity for all of the pregnant patients who had a singleton gestation and a positive \\nresult on a SARS-CoV-2 virologic test.5 The data suggested that adverse perinatal outcomes were more \\ncommon in patients with severe or critical disease than in asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection, including an increased incidence of cesarean delivery (59.6% vs. 34.0% of patients; aRR \\n1.57; 95% CI, 1.30–1.90), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (40.4% vs. 18.8%; aRR 1.61; 95% CI, \\n1.18–2.20), and preterm birth (41.8% vs. 11.9%; aRR 3.53; 95% CI, 2.42–5.14). The perinatal outcomes \\nfor those with mild to moderate illness were similar to those observed among asymptomatic patients \\nwith SARS-CoV-2 infection. \\nAmong 1,249,634 delivery hospitalizations in the United States from March 2020 through September \\n2021, women with COVID-19 had an increased risk of stillbirth, which was defined as fetal death at >20 \\nweeks’ gestation (aRR 1.90; 95% CI, 1.69–2.15).6 The risk of stillbirth was higher during the time period \\nthat Delta was the dominant variant in the United States (aRR 4.04; 95% CI, 3.28–4.97) than during the \\npre-Delta period (aRR 1.47; 95% CI, 1.27–1.71). \\nA retrospective cohort analysis collected data from 14,104 pregnant or recently postpartum individuals \\nwho delivered at U.S. hospitals that participated in the Gestational Research Assessments for COVID-19 \\n(GRA VID) study.7 Compared with pregnant individuals who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection, \\npatients with COVID-19 during pregnancy had an increased risk of meeting the composite endpoint \\nof maternal death or severe morbidity related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, postpartum \\nhemorrhage, or infection. Eighty percent of the patients in this cohort tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection during the third trimester.

There were also no significant differences between these groups in the rates \\nof gestational hypertension overall or preeclampsia with severe features. These data suggest that those \\nwith SARS-CoV-2 infection early in gestation may also have an increased risk of subsequent adverse \\npregnancy outcomes. \\nVertical Transmission of COVID-19\\nAlthough vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible, current data suggest that it is rare.9 A review \\nof 101 infants born to 100 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection at a single U.S. academic medical center \\nfound that 2 infants (2%) had indeterminate SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results, \\nwhich were presumed to be positive. However, the infants exhibited no evidence of clinical disease. It is \\nreassuring that the majority of the infants received negative PCR results after rooming with their mothers \\nand breastfeeding directly (the mothers in this study practiced appropriate hand and breast hygiene).\\nData collected by the CDC as part of the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies \\nNetwork showed that among 4,038 infants born to people with COVID-19, for whom laboratory testing \\ninformation was available and who were tested during the delivery hospitalization, 227 infants (5.6%) \\nhad positive PCR results for SARS-CoV-2.10\\nThe published data to date were largely collected prior to the emergence of the Omicron variants. The \\nrisk of vertical transmission may vary based on viral dynamics and the transmissibility of the circulating \\nvariants in a community. However, the variant-specific factors associated with vertical transmission have \\nnot been determined. For additional information on vertical transmission and infants born to people with \\nSARS-CoV-2 infection, see Special Considerations in Children. \\nRacial and Ethnic Disparities Among Pregnant People With COVID-19\\nBetween January 22 and June 7, 2020, the CDC received reports of 8,207 women who were pregnant at \\nthe time of their COVID-19 diagnosis. Among these women, 46% were reported to be Hispanic, and 22% \\nwere reported to be Black.11 Those proportions were higher than the proportions of Hispanic (24%) and \\nBlack (15%) women who gave birth in 2019, suggesting that pregnant people who are Hispanic or Black \\nmay be disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is important to note that these disparities \\nare related to social determinants of health, current and historic inequities in access to health care and \\nother resources, and structural racism. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) \\nhas published guidance on addressing health equity during the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nPrevention of COVID-19 in Pregnancy\\nPregnant people should be counseled about the increased risk for severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 \\ninfection and the measures they can take to protect themselves and their families from infection. \\nNonpharmacologic measures include practicing physical distancing, washing hands regularly, and \\nwearing a face covering as per guidance from the CDC. \\nCOVID-19 Vaccines\\nThe COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends against withholding COVID-19 \\nvaccination from pregnant or lactating individuals specifically because of pregnancy or lactation (AIII).\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Maternal immunoglobulin G antibody levels were \\nsimilar after vaccination in pregnant and lactating women and in nonpregnant controls, and the antibody \\nresponse did not differ by trimester of vaccination. Vaccinated pregnant women had significantly higher \\nlevels of antibodies than pregnant women who had had natural SARS-CoV-2 infection during the \\nprevious 4 to 12 weeks.\\nAntibody Transfer to the Neonate \\nThe available data indicate that vaccine-derived antibodies are passively transferred to the neonate during \\npregnancy and lactation.18 A case control study that was conducted at 20 pediatric hospitals in 17 states \\nin the United States from July 1, 2021, to January 17, 2022, assessed the relationship between maternal \\nvaccination with a 2-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and pediatric hospitalization for \\nCOVID-19.12 In this study, 379 infants aged <6 months were hospitalized. Among these infants, 176 had \\nCOVID-19 and were considered case infants. The remaining 203 infants did not have COVID-19 and \\nwere considered control infants. Sixteen percent of the mothers of the case infants had received 2 doses of \\nCOVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy compared with 32% of the mothers of control infants.\\nMaternal completion of a 2-dose primary mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series during pregnancy led to \\na decrease in the number of infant hospitalizations for COVID-19 during the first 6 months of life (61% \\ndecrease; 95% CI, 31% to 78%).12 There were no statistically significant differences between the case \\ninfants and control infants in the presence of underlying medical conditions or the occurrence of premature \\nbirth. Of the 43 case infants who were admitted to the ICU, 88% had mothers who were unvaccinated. \\nThese data further support the CDC’s recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination in people who are \\npregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to become pregnant or who might become pregnant in the future.16 \\nSafety \\nA study that used data from 3 vaccine safety reporting systems in the United States reported that the \\nfrequency of adverse events among 35,691 vaccine recipients who identified as pregnant was similar to \\nthe frequency observed among nonpregnant patients.19 Local injection site pain, nausea, and vomiting \\nwere reported slightly more frequently in pregnant people than in nonpregnant people.

The illness severity, underlying \\ncomorbidities, and clinical status of pregnant patients who have symptoms compatible with COVID-19 \\nshould be assessed to determine whether in-person evaluation for potential hospitalization is needed. \\nIf hospitalization for COVID-19 is indicated, care should be provided in a facility that can conduct \\nmaternal and fetal monitoring, when appropriate. General management of COVID-19 in pregnant \\npatients should include:\\n• Fetal and uterine contraction monitoring based on gestational age, when appropriate\\n• Individualized delivery planning\\n• A multispecialty, team-based approach that may include consultation with obstetric, maternal-fetal \\nmedicine, infectious disease, pulmonary-critical care, and pediatric specialists, as appropriate\\nIn general, the recommendations for managing COVID-19 in nonpregnant patients also apply to \\npregnant patients.\\nTherapeutic Management of COVID-19 in the Setting of Pregnancy\\nTo date, most SARS-CoV-2-related clinical trials have excluded individuals who are pregnant or \\nlactating. In cases where lactating and pregnant individuals have been included in studies, only a small \\nnumber have been enrolled. This makes providing evidence-based recommendations on the use of \\nanti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies in these vulnerable patients difficult and potentially limits their treatment \\noptions.

It is not known whether abatacept is \\ntransferred to breast milk during lactation or whether it is absorbed systemically by the infant. Because \\nabatacept is a large molecule, only small amounts are thought to be transferred to breast milk. Patients \\nwho are receiving abatacept may consider breastfeeding.\\nBaricitinib\\nPregnancy\\nWhen deciding whether to prescribe baricitinib to a pregnant individual, clinicians need to consider the \\nseverity of the patient’s COVID-19, the patient’s comorbidities, and the gestational age of the fetus.\\nBaricitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor. As a small-molecule drug, baricitinib is likely to pass through \\nthe placenta; therefore, fetal risk cannot be ruled out.3 In animal studies, baricitinib doses that exceeded \\nthe therapeutic human dose were associated with embryofetal developmental abnormalities. Pregnancy \\nregistries provide some data on the use of tofacitinib, another Janus kinase inhibitor, during pregnancy \\nfor other conditions (e.g., ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis).4-6 Pregnancy outcomes \\namong the participants who received tofacitinib were similar to those among the general population. \\nLactation\\nThere is no information on the use of baricitinib in lactating people or on the effects of baricitinib on \\nbreastfed infants; however, baricitinib has been detected in the breast milk of lactating rats.7 Feeding \\nbreast milk should be avoided for 4 days (approximately 5–6 elimination half-lives) after baricitinib is \\ndiscontinued. \\nDexamethasone\\nPregnancy\\nA short course of betamethasone or dexamethasone, which are both known to cross the placenta, is \\nroutinely used to decrease neonatal complications of prematurity in people who are at risk of imminent \\npreterm birth.8,9 Treating COVID-19 with a short course of dexamethasone can lower the risk of death in \\npregnant individuals. In addition, dexamethasone carries a low risk of fetal adverse effects. \\nLactation\\nDexamethasone should be offered to lactating patients with COVID-19 who qualify for this therapy. \\nBreast milk can be fed to the infant while the lactating patient is receiving dexamethasone. Although \\nthere are limited data on the use of dexamethasone in lactating patients, some published reports about \\na related antenatal corticosteroid (betamethasone) reported a time-limited decrease in the volume of \\nbreast milk production.10,11 Given the benefits of breast milk, additional lactation support has been \\nrecommended if needed. \\nHeparin (Low-Molecular-Weight and Unfractionated)\\nPregnancy \\nIn general, the preferred anticoagulants during pregnancy are heparin compounds. Because of its \\nreliability and ease of administration, low-molecular-weight heparin is recommended rather than \\nunfractionated heparin for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in pregnant people.\\nThe use of anticoagulant therapy during labor and delivery requires specialized care and planning. The \\nmanagement of anticoagulant therapy in pregnant patients with COVID-19 should be similar to the \\nmanagement used for pregnant patients with other conditions.\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Molnupiravir is not authorized for use in children aged <18 \\nyears. Because the risk of adverse effects in infants is currently unknown, the FDA Emergency Use \\nAuthorization fact sheet does not recommend feeding an infant breast milk from a patient who is taking \\nmolnupiravir for the duration of the treatment course and until 4 days after the final dose.1 \\nRemdesivir\\nPregnancy\\nWhile pregnant individuals were excluded from the clinical trials that evaluated the safety and efficacy \\nof remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19, subsequent reports on the use of remdesivir in pregnant \\nindividuals have been reassuring.

The \\npatients tolerated ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir well, with no serious adverse effects noted in either the \\npregnant patients or the neonates during the study period. \\nThe other case series included 7 patients with a mean gestational age of 26.4 weeks who initiated \\nritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir after approximately 2 days of COVID-19 symptoms.19 One patient \\ndeveloped dysgeusia and stopped treatment, but the remaining 6 patients completed 5 days of treatment. \\nSix of the patients were fully vaccinated, and 4 of these patients had also received a booster dose. All the \\npatients reported resolution of their COVID-19 symptoms, and no fetal or neonatal adverse effects were \\nobserved during the study period.\\nRitonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be offered to pregnant and recently pregnant patients with \\nCOVID-19 who qualify for this therapy based on the results of a risk-benefit assessment. The risk-\\nbenefit assessment may include factors such as medical comorbidities, body mass index, vaccination \\nstatus, and the number and severity of the risk factors for severe disease. \\nObstetricians should be aware of potential drug-drug interactions when prescribing this agent. See \\nDrug-Drug Interactions Between Ritonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and Concomitant \\nMedications for more information.\\nLactation\\nStudies of infants who were exposed to ritonavir through breast milk suggest that the amount of ritonavir \\nthat transfers through breast milk is negligible and not considered clinically significant.20-23 \\nThere are no data on the use of nirmatrelvir in lactating people.

Because the overall oral absorption of nirmatrelvir is poor, it is unlikely that the levels \\nof nirmatrelvir absorbed from breast milk ingestion would be clinically relevant or expected to cause \\nadverse effects in an infant.25\\nTocilizumab\\nPregnancy\\nPregnant individuals have been excluded from clinical trials that evaluated the use of the anti-\\ninterleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19. An analysis of \\ndata from a global safety database reported pregnancy outcomes from 288 women who were exposed \\nto tocilizumab during their pregnancies.26 Eighty-nine percent of these women received tocilizumab \\nas ongoing treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and most were exposed to tocilizumab during their first \\ntrimester. The rates of congenital abnormalities among the infants born to these women were not higher \\nthan the rates seen in the general population. However, an increased rate of preterm birth was observed \\namong these individuals when compared with the general population. A retrospective report of 61 \\npregnant women who were exposed to tocilizumab at conception or during their first trimesters showed \\nno increased rates of congenital abnormalities or spontaneous abortion.27 \\nAs pregnancy progresses, monoclonal antibodies are actively transported across the placenta, with the \\ngreatest transfer occurring during the third trimester. This may affect immune responses in the exposed \\nfetus. If a pregnant patient receives tocilizumab after 20 weeks’ gestation, clinicians should delay \\nadministering live viral vaccines to the infant for at least 6 months.\\nLactation\\nThere is limited information on the use of tocilizumab in lactating patients. Based on case report data, \\nthe amount of tocilizumab transferred to the infant via breast milk appears to be very low, with no \\nreports of adverse effects.28\\nReferences\\n1.

People with acute COVID-19 who have not received an influenza vaccine should be \\nvaccinated after they recover from acute illness and are no longer in isolation (BIII). Patients may be \\nvaccinated while they are still in isolation if they are in a health care setting.\\nThere are currently no data on the safety, immunogenicity, or efficacy of administering influenza \\nvaccines to patients with acute COVID-19 or those who are recovering from COVID-19. Vaccination \\nin people who have mild illness is safe and effective.2 Clinicians should consider deferring influenza \\nvaccination for symptomatic patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 until they have recovered and \\ncompleted their COVID-19 isolation period. It is not known whether administering dexamethasone or \\nother immunomodulatory therapies to patients with severe COVID-19 will affect the immune response \\nto the influenza vaccine. People with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or mild COVID-19 should \\nseek influenza vaccination when they no longer require isolation. They may be vaccinated sooner if they \\nare in a health care setting for other reasons. See the influenza vaccine recommendations from the CDC \\nand the American Academy of Pediatrics. \\nCoadministration of COVID-19 Vaccines and Influenza Vaccines\\nCoadministration of a COVID-19 vaccine and an influenza vaccine at different injection sites has been \\nshown to be safe.3-6 Providers and patients should be aware of a potential increase in reactogenicity \\nwhen both vaccines are administered concurrently. The CDC and ACIP provide more information on \\ncoadministering influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. \\nClinical Presentation of Influenza Versus COVID-19\\nThe signs and symptoms of uncomplicated, clinically mild influenza overlap with those of mild \\nCOVID-19. Loss of taste and smell can occur with both diseases, but these symptoms are more \\ncommon with COVID-19 than with influenza. Fever is not always present in patients with either \\ndisease, particularly in young infants, adults of advanced age, and patients who are immunosuppressed. \\nComplications of influenza and COVID-19 can be similar, but the onset of influenza complications and \\nsevere disease typically occurs within a week of illness, whereas the onset of severe COVID-19 usually \\noccurs in the second week of illness. \\nBecause of the overlap in signs and symptoms, when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are \\ncocirculating, diagnostic testing for both viruses is needed to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 \\nand influenza virus infection and to identify coinfection in people with an acute respiratory illness. \\nCoinfection with influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 has been described in case reports and case series,7-11 \\nbut it is uncommon.12 Observational studies have reported greater disease severity in adult patients \\nwith influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection than in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection alone.13,14 \\nIn pediatric patients, coinfection with the 2 viruses was associated with greater disease severity than \\ninfection with influenza virus alone.15 \\nTesting for SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza\\nThe COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends performing influenza testing in \\naddition to SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatients with acute respiratory illness if the results will change the \\nclinical management strategy for the patient (e.g., administering antiviral treatment for influenza) (BIII). \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

These comorbidities include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, \\ncardiovascular disease, a history of smoking, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and cancer.38 \\nThere are a number of case reports and case series that describe the clinical presentation of COVID-19 \\nin people with HIV .4-11,28,39 These studies indicate that the clinical presentation of COVID-19 is similar in \\npeople with and without HIV . Most of the published reports describe populations in which the majority \\nof individuals with HIV are receiving ART and have achieved virologic suppression. Consequently, the \\ncurrent understanding of the impact of COVID-19 in people with advanced HIV and low CD4 counts or \\npersistent HIV viremia is limited. \\nManaging COVID-19 in People With HIV\\nThe recommendations for the triage, management, and treatment of COVID-19 in people with HIV \\nare the same as those for the general population (AIII). Nonhospitalized people with HIV and mild \\nto moderate COVID-19 may be eligible to receive the therapies that are currently recommended for \\ntreatment (see Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19). However, in \\nsituations where there are logistical constraints for administering these therapies, priority should be \\ngiven to those with untreated or advanced HIV (AIII). \\nWhen starting treatment for COVID-19 in patients with HIV , clinicians should pay careful attention \\nto potential drug-drug interactions and overlapping toxicities among COVID-19 treatments, ARV \\nmedications, antimicrobial therapies, and other medications (AIII). \\nAmong the antiviral drugs recommended for nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19, drug-drug \\ninteractions are a special concern with the use of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid). People with \\nHIV who are receiving a 5-day course of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir to treat COVID-19 can continue \\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Before prescribing \\nritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir to a patient who is not already on a ritonavir-based or cobicistat-based \\nregimen, clinicians should carefully review the patient’s concomitant medications, including over-\\nthe-counter medications, herbal supplements, and recreational drugs, to evaluate potential drug-drug \\ninteractions. Clinicians should use resources such as Drug-Drug Interactions Between Ritonavir-Boosted \\nNirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and Concomitant Medications, the Food and Drug Administration prescribing \\ninformation for ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and the Liverpool COVID-19 Drug Interactions website \\nfor additional guidance on identifying and managing drug-drug interactions. \\nIn hospitalized patients, the appropriate treatment strategy depends on disease severity (see Therapeutic \\nManagement of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19). Dexamethasone, which is recommended for use \\nin combination with baricitinib or tocilizumab for some patients with severe or critical COVID-19, is \\nan immunosuppressive agent. The safety of using this drug in patients who are immunocompromised, \\nincluding those with advanced HIV , has not been studied. Therefore, patients with advanced HIV who \\nare receiving dexamethasone should be closely monitored for secondary infections. \\nDexamethasone is a dose-dependent inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4 and could potentially lower \\nthe levels of certain coadministered ARV drugs. More than a single dose of dexamethasone is not \\nrecommended for patients receiving rilpivirine as part of their ARV regimen. Clinicians should consult \\nan HIV specialist before administering dexamethasone to these patients. It is currently unknown whether \\nadministering ≤10 days of dexamethasone impacts the clinical efficacy of other ARV drugs. Patients \\nwith HIV who are receiving dexamethasone as treatment for COVID-19 should follow up with their \\nHIV care providers to assess their virologic response.\\nAlthough some ARV drugs were studied early in the pandemic for the treatment of COVID-19, none of \\nthese agents have been shown to be effective. \\nManaging HIV in People With COVID-19\\nPeople with HIV who develop COVID-19, including those who require hospitalization, should continue \\ntheir ART and their medications for the treatment or prevention of opportunistic infections whenever \\npossible. If a patient with HIV needs to receive the next dose of the long-acting injectables cabotegravir/\\nrilpivirine, ibalizumab, or lenacapavir while hospitalized for COVID-19, clinicians should make \\narrangements with the patient’s hospital provider to continue administering the medication without \\ninterruption. ART interruption may lead to rebound viremia, and, in some cases, the emergence of drug \\nresistance. If the appropriate ARV drugs are not on the hospital’s formulary, administer medications \\nfrom the patient’s home supplies, if available.\\nClinicians treating COVID-19 in people with HIV should consult an HIV specialist before adjusting \\nor switching a patient’s ARV medications. An ARV regimen should not be modified for the purpose of \\npreventing or treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many drugs, including some ARV agents (e.g., lopinavir/\\nritonavir, boosted darunavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine), were evaluated in clinical \\ntrials or have been prescribed off-label to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lopinavir/ritonavir \\nand darunavir/cobicistat have not been found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.40,41 \\nFor patients receiving an investigational ARV medication as part of their ARV regimen, arrangements \\nshould be made with the investigational study team to continue the medication, if possible.\\nFor critically ill patients who require tube feeding, some ARV medications are available in liquid \\nformulations, and some ARV pills may be crushed. Clinicians should consult an HIV specialist and/or \\npharmacist to assess the best way to continue an effective ARV regimen for a patient with a feeding tube. \\nInformation may be available in the drug product label or from the Toronto General Hospital.\\nDownloaded from on 3/1/2024\\nhttps://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Pregnant individuals with HIV who have \\nCOVID-19 should be triaged, managed, and treated the same way as pregnant individuals without HIV . \\nClinicians should consider any additional comorbidities when assessing the risk of severe COVID-19 \\nin these patients. See Pregnancy, Lactation, and COVID-19 Therapeutics for information regarding the \\ntherapies recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. \\nPregnant individuals with HIV who are hospitalized for COVID-19 should continue their ART and \\nopportunistic infection treatment and prophylaxis. Clinicians should consult an HIV specialist if any \\nchanges to ARV regimens are needed.\\nConsiderations in Children\\nIn general, children appear less likely to become severely ill with COVID-19 than adults. In the few \\npublications that have described cases of COVID-19 among children or adolescents with HIV , most \\ncases were mild, and HIV did not appear to be an independent predictor of severe COVID-19.44-47 \\nChildren with HIV who are eligible should receive COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses regardless \\nof their CD4 count or viral load. Children with HIV and COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory \\nsyndrome in children (MIS-C) should receive the same treatment as children without HIV . See \\nTherapeutic Management of Hospitalized Children With COVID-19, Therapeutic Management of \\nNonhospitalized Children With COVID-19, and Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Children With \\nMIS-C, Plus a Discussion on MIS-A for more information. \\nParents of children with HIV and COVID-19 should be advised to continue their child’s ART without \\ninterruption if the child is being managed at home. For children with HIV who are hospitalized for \\nCOVID-19, ART should be continued for the duration of hospitalization. \\nReferences\\n1. Harris NS, Johnson AS, Huang YA, et al.
